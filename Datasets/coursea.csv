Machine Learning,Stanford University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning,machine-learning,"This is an extremely basic course. Machine learning is built on mathematics, yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs, which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized. So much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities, and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge, that in the end I abandoned the videos altogether. The quizes were basic (largely based on recall of, rather than application of knowledge), as were the programming assignments (nearly all of which were spoon-fed, with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices together).If you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics (e.g. elementary linear algebra and probability), do yourself a favour and take Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course instead, which is far more interesting and doesn't shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models.",By Deleted A,"Mar 18, 2017",1
Indigenous Canada,University of Alberta,https://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada,indigenous-canada,"There are several reasons why I rated this course as being poor.  First, the presentation style does not make use of the capabilities of the medium, namely a significant (perhaps 70 to 80%) portion of the course is just lecturing.   There are flashes of material on the screen behind the presenter but, most of the time, there is no specific discussion of the picture, diagram or map.   The course would be enhanced significantly by using videos, real interviews (rather than just having the interviewee speak about the topic just like a lecturer), and by really incorporating graphics into the presentation.   My second reason is that the material is presented in a very superficial manner.   I realize that this is an introductory course but the course organizers/presenters need to go in depth into a few of the examples rather than just quickly going over them.    Thirdly, there is very limited resource material given and the access to that material is not very user friendly.    For example, if one wanted to get more information on a  particular treaty, it would be helpful to have the reference to that directly incorporated into the course notes so that one could click on the reference and bring up an article with more details.

The Science of Well-Being,Yale University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being,the-science-of-well-being,"The course is mostly about the opinion of the lecturer, which can be summed up to ""social media is bad"" and ""money doesn't make you happy"".  A very simple minded world view is presented, without critical notions challenging that view or the more complex science behind emotions.From Yale I would have expected a course that challenges such simple views and empoweres students to find the ideal path for themselves.",By Julia H,"May 01, 2018",1
Technical Support Fundamentals,Google,https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals,technical-support-fundamentals,"Course was good overall. I will not take the time to discuss in detail the information taught; it was delivered well and was valuable. However, after watching many many minutes of these videos, it became really redundant for the first 15 seconds of each video to be an animation reminding me of where I am in the course. This is redundant because it is obvious where you are in the course when you navigate to any video.. in any course. The website displays where you are. I do not feel I need to be reminded with 15-20 seconds of silent animations showing me where I am; I just want the video to start. Secondly, it was really frustrating to be failed on the final writing by my peers for the most heinous complaint. We were directed to describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to someone who has never seen one before. Because this is all the information given, I have to assume the user has seen some sand-which; just not a peanut butter and jelly one. I do not feel I should have to teach someone how to open a bag of bread. It should be common knowledge that something has to be opened to get it out. I should not have to teach kitchen etiquette and cleanliness. One user who failed me commented that because I did not direct him to set the bread on to a clean plate... that he was confused; and could have mis understood to the point where he placed the sandwich on the floor. Another user said that I should have described how to hold the knife. He did not know if he should hold it by the sharp end, or the handle. One of those users marked me off for not being concise because it did not use bullet points or numbers and that he was expecting a recipe format. Look! I am not here to suppose a user came out of a cave. When you fail me for these types of issues using this logic; that same logic makes me think I should describe how to make a sandwich by growing your own wheat, making grain, baking bread, growing strawberries to make jelly, etc. But I did not go that far! No... I simply re wrote my project and upload to accommodate these 3 users by including that the bread should be opened, how to hold a a utensil, and I even included images of the sandwich so that the user could check their work as it is assembled to ensure the user could make a sandwich in 14 simple short sentence steps labeled accordingly. Well guess what?! My project was graded by another 3 users who complained that it is common sense how to hold a knife and remove bread from a bag and that I should have given them more credit for having some level of food assembly knowledge and I barely passed. I passed by 1 point. Yah, they almost failed me for being too lengthy. Honestly, I only added 3 or 4 short sentences compared to the original. Being graded by your peers gives too brought of feedback in cases like this. If the last 3 users would have graded by first paper, I would have passed. If the first set of users would have graded by second paper I would have passed. Lastly, I got an email upon completion of the first course that said my certificate was ready to print once I uploaded my photo ID (drivers license) along with a second photo of me for validation. Once I uploaded these 2 images; I got a notice that there was no certificate to be given for this particular course. I would not have shared my personal information with you at this point in time if I knew nothing would be available to print yet. That too was frustrating. ",By Daniel W,"May 23, 2018",1

Financial Markets,Yale University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global,financial-markets-global,"This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",By James R,"Apr 23, 2019",1
Introduction to Psychology,Yale University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology,introduction-psychology,"I am so sorry to say that the ""animation"" makes this course impossible to get through. Imagine your lecturer but without eye contact, without body language or the slow pacing across the front of the room, without the subtle human connection we take for granted. Instead he is replaced by the same 5 drawings repeated ad nauseum against the same stagnant background. Add some literal nausea by slowly zooming in and out for no reason and some obnoxious sound effects to drown out the speaker which in no way improves the his otherwise calm and deliberate lecture style.I've taken a couple classes with Coursera, including a Paul Bloom Course I enjoyed immensely. This the first course I've spent money on. I deeply regret not watching a couple videos before purchasing the course. ",By Jacquelin B,"Dec 10, 2018",1
Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python),University of Michigan,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python,python,I did not find this course helpful. The assignments seem to ask for more info that you've been taught in any of the videos. My analogy for the course is this: It's like making a newborn baby watch a video on swimming and then throwing it into the ocean and acting shocked when it doesn't know how to swim. The mentors in the discussion forum are condescending and do not help when you don't understand the terms they are using.

The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking,Google,https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-networking,computer-networking,"As a complete and utter beginner to IT, I feel like all of the information presented in this course is in a backward and awkward way. Everything feels so segmented that I'm having a lot of trouble putting it all together in the correct way. There doesn't seem to be a natural flow to any of the lessons and it feels more like a professional stating something than actually teaching it. I've had to completely use outside sources for how to actually do the Peer Review assignment. I feel like all the learning I've done is from hearing about it here and researching it elsewhere.",By Kelley F,"Oct 26, 2018",1

Crash Course on Python,Google,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course,python-crash-course,"I can't give this course higher than 1 star until they fix the bugs in the quizzes.For those of you who say ""It works for me, it's a problem in your code"", you may not have enough experience with these types of bugs. For Week 3 Quiz - While Loops, problems 3 & 4:Bug observations: 1) Works intermittently. In problem 3, it kept saying ""No Output"" when running it. I switched from Edge (Chromium) browser to Chrome, and it worked. Same code. Then, I retook the test (still in Chrome), and problem 3 timed out even though it passed previously and the code was the same. 2) Code works fine in an external IDE such as VS Code and PyCharm, but when typed in manually into Coursera, it will time out or say ""No Output"". 3) Problem 4 will keep outputting a progress bar when you run it with messages saying ""Compiling, uploading, going to the moon and back,..."" before finally outputting the correct solution. Then when submitting the quiz, it ""Times Out After 5"" No doubt due to 'going to the Moon and back'.My credentials:I am a professional Software Engineer with over 13 years of experience working at Amazon and Microsoft.

Psychological First Aid,Johns Hopkins University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/psychological-first-aid,psychological-first-aid,"Unfortunately, I think this class missed the mark.  Though the explanation of the RAPID model was adequate, I don't think the assessments were consistent with the material (mentioning a topic in a slide is not discussing it).  When taking the assessment, if I get a wrong answer, explain why it's wrong in the review.  Let the assessment continue to be a learning tool - otherwise it's trial and error.  I thought the videos were incredibly outdated and showed little practical application.  The vignettes were probably the most helpful, however I don't feel adequately prepared for deployment.  That is, what does actual deployment look like?  It was stated in one of the last sessions that we should expect 8-15 victims/day - what does that truly look like?  One person in a gym with one client doesn't give me the ""feel.""  I would have liked to see a typical setup for PFA responders, show the chaos vs. organization, the panic vs. calm, the typical vs. atypical.

Neural Networks and Deep Learning,DeepLearning.AI,https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning,neural-networks-deep-learning,"This is a good course with good explanation but the only problem with this course is that it covers so much information all at once during the entire week and then there is just literally one or two programming assignment at the end. There should be exercise questions after every video to apply those skills taught in theory into programming. I now know general concept of deep learning but I still barely have a clue on how to code those concepts. If I wanted to code all that myself I still wouldn't even know where to start, where to get the data etc etc because the programming assignments were  just, now write this, now write that. Also there should be a help button where mentors should be available because we have tons of questions after learning a new concept. We cant just type all questions in the discussions forum and then then wait till someone replies and then that question gets lost among the pile of other questions. Especially in programming assignments when we get stuck and then dont have a clue what to do now. For $50 a month, the teaching structure is really poor.

Also, the whole subject of the course is the professor's book, word for word, so that means in case you buy the book, you have the hole course, but not the certificate.The least I can say, is that this act is unprofessional, anti-ideological, and it does not take the course in another level with more knowledge.",By Theodoros E,"Nov 10, 2018",1

They also say your brain will work better if you exercise and get a good night's sleep. Are you serious? This is your advice? Could this be any more obvious?

Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User,Google,https://www.coursera.org/learn/os-power-user,os-power-user,"Unfortunately I have to rate this course rather low due to the nature of the labs. The information and the instructor were great and deserve a 5 star rating. Cindy was very well spoken and knowledgable about the topics that were covered. I'm not sure who has a stake in Qwiklabs (if anyone at all), but the labs that you are required to take as part of the quizzes for this particular course are just flat out poorly implemented. To begin with, for several weeks I was unable to participate in the labs - often having to wait 24-72 hours just to get in at all. I was continually getting the ""Due to overwhelming response"" error. There was no possible way that all of the labs were ""full"" constantly around the clock for days on end. This error persisted for around 2 weeks. I am paying $50 a month for this service, and to me, this error is unacceptable. Then there was the issue of labs not recognizing the tasks that were completed. For some of the labs the ""fix"" to this issue was waiting up to 30 minutes just to begin them to ensure the VM instance was fully loaded. This is another unacceptable error for a service I'm paying a lot of money for. The idea and the concept of the labs running through a VM instance is brilliant, but the implementation of these labs through the Qwiklabs portal was without a doubt a fumble on somebody's part, and quite frankly based on this one course alone I could not recommend anyone to sign up for the Google IT certificate unless the Qwiklabs issues would be rectified.

Tools for Data Science,IBM,https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science,open-source-tools-for-data-science,I am amazed that IBM even put this course out on Coursera. It is the worst course I have come across. It is a humongous waste of time. It supposedly introduces the IBM Watson Studio but ALL the videos are outdated and do not reflect the platform currently on IBM's website. It is impossible to follow the instructions. You just have to sign up to the platform and hobble along trying to make sense of it. The quizzes were a utter waste of time. They don't even reflect the content in the videos. Many of the questions had topics that were not even covered. I was unable to do the final assignment because it's impossible to get to the Jupyter notebooks page when you sign in. It was an incredibly frustrating experience. I wasn't alone - the discussion forums are filled with hundreds of comments on the same issue - not being able to find the webpage where they need to create a notebook and do the assignment. I did not see any of the moderators even bothering to reply. Why have you put this course out here if you have no interest in providing quality content or help when your content is utterly outdated.

I felt this way after the first course of this series, but even more so now. Yes, I understand the material, but the programming assignments really don't amount to more than ""filling in the blanks""--that doesn't really test whether or not I've mastered the material. I understand that this is terribly hard to accomplish through a MOOC, and having taught university-level courses myself, I understand how much effort is involved in doing so in the ""real world"". In either case, if I'm paying for a course, I expect to have a solid grasp on the material after completing the material, and though you've clearly put effort into assembling the programming exercises, they don't really gauge this on any level. Perhaps it would be worth considering a higher cost of the course in order to justify the level of effort required to put together assessments that genuinely put the student through their paces in order to assure that a ""100%"" mark genuinely reflects both to you and the learner that they have truly internalized and mastered the material.

Diversity and inclusion in the workplace,ESSEC Business School,https://www.coursera.org/learn/diversity-inclusion-workplace,diversity-inclusion-workplace,"I thought this course was uninteresting, hard to understand in some of its language & with the way that it explained some things as well as when it came to directions and what was expected of you for certain assignments particularly essays. Parts of the course lacked direction and one could argue that some of the material was heavily biased. I would also like to say that many of the articles and videos outside Coursera that we were asked to read and watch were either no longer active or hidden behind a pay wall which made it hard to complete some assignments and understand certain parts of the course. Most of the videos were long, rambling, and hard to follow. A lot of the language and ideas/laws discussed seemed largely geared toward certain European countries or Europe as a whole and didn't really apply much to the United States. Certain parts of the course would say that they were optional or that participation in that section was optional but if you had not completed that exercise you would not be able to finish other assignments later down the line which could get kind of confusing, if something is ""optional"" you should not have to participate in it in order to complete the course.",By Daniel W,"Dec 02, 2019",1
Design and Interpretation of Clinical Trials,Johns Hopkins University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-trials,clinical-trials,"It is hard to describe what I didn't like about this course. I have a reasonable statistical background as well as a basic science and public health background, so I may be overly familiar with the material. I  didn't find that going through the material helped me beyond what I could intuit from the basic principles of how to do a study. This isn't good, because I feel like someone without my background would be overwhelmed by the information presented and not be able to follow it. I also believe the lecture style was too conversational and not very organized. It feels like a little bit too much like the introduction to a journal club with 3rd year graduate students. The course should be for novices. Ultimately, everything felt like it was being described rather than taught.  One positive I can say, is that I think the basic contents of the course are good, they just need to be organized properly and distilled down and focused.

Social Psychology,Wesleyan University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-psychology,social-psychology,"Unfortunately this course isn't what I expected it to be. First off, there's too much pressure to join Social Psychology Network for a fee. You're constantly reminded of how much better the assignment would be better if you tried it on the network and you'd gain a lot more from the course by joining on there and utilizing the resources available on that website. Secondly, I did think there was way too much emphasis on research methods and findings. Albeit I have only completed 2 weeks of the course, perhaps my comments are a bit premature. Nevertheless, I believe the course description ought to be revised, as there's more emphasis on various researches throughout history and the methods of those researches, as opposed to understanding ""why we do  what we do"" as stated in the course description.

For a course about User Experience taught by a person with a background in psychology, the course design is a joke and very user-unfriendly. There are no practical elements to this course. Any UX person should know that they should offer opportunities for self-discovery of material via hands-on tasks. The quizzes pretty much just ask you to regurgitate material via rote learning.

Introduction to Marketing,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-marketing,wharton-marketing,"This course on Marketing is a marketing disaster for WhartonOnline. This course made me understand atleast one thing in great clarity, that I should not waste money on Wharton courses. The amount of effort put into the course material, into the organization and flow of material (or lack thereof), and into the quality of videos and content delivery, would sum up right about to Zero. Needless to say, this review is going to be highly critical, since I expected some value and quality from a school like Wharton. Should you pay $95 for this course. I think they should pay you for wasting your time. The course tries to teach the importance of branding, and customer centricity, and personifies how not to do it.Here are some specific complaints I have with the course, in no particular order. You might not agree with all of them, and some might seem insignificant, but in any case, here they are :1. Platform : The entire course is just a series of videos, and plenty of them are over 15 minutes long. It's hard to imagine that students would be able to keep their attention, and grasp new and/or tough concepts with such an approach. A combination of text, figures, videos, and interactive exercises would have made it much easier to grasp the material2. Videos : High school kids can make multimedia of better quality. Videos consist of someone talking for several minutes, with occasional inclusion of presentation slides. Slides are no help either. It seems material is copied out of a text book, then pasted into a slide, and then integrated into a video. And then professor spends a few minutes reading out the text of the slides. The diagrams are lifeless, asymmetrical and does not help advance the understanding.3. Structure : The order in which videos are presented doesn't make sense. There is no structure to the material which would help you understand the concepts in a logical and progressive manner. Sometimes, the heading of the video does not even seem to match with the content. It feels all videos were filmed in an ad hoc fashion and then just put together in a random order.4. Discussion Forum is not a great help either. You would want to see more activity and brainstorming there, considering so many students take this course. But, there is no incentive for the students to share ideas and contribute, since passing the course does not depend on discussion forums. When ""Mentors"" reply to some answers, those answers seemed to be pasted out of a text book.   5. Quiz : In its current structure, there is no point of having a quiz at the end of the week. The goal should be assimilating or internalizing the material and concepts, not just pass the quiz. The course allows you to retake a quiz upto 3 times a week, so you don't really need to go through the videos at all. They don't check if you went through all the videos before taking the quiz. And they don't give you answers and explanation after the quiz is done, since then the students would always score 100% on the second try. If I can not even understand where my understanding lacks and fix it, why am I taking this quiz. 8. Final Exam : You can find answers to most questions by just searching the key phrase in the course material.  And they help you in doing that by telling you which Professor's videos you need to search. They don't test you on concepts, they test you whether you can remember what the Professor X meant when he/she made a statement Y. 9. Content Delivery: I found second week to be the best in terms of content delivery, but the rest of the weeks were more or less lacking. The examples or analogies given did not always match the concept introduced. If you read the transcript of the videos, the sentences spoken would not even make much sense. Many times, you can find the professor glancing down, as if looking at the laptop screen besides her, to read out the slides. The professor comes out as nervous and fidgety, which is very distracting, to say the least. If you are still reading this review, I hope you would spend your $95 on a subscription to a business magazine, or may be just on some good food. This course is definitely not worth it, and it 'll cost you more in your precious time.",By aseem b,"Aug 08, 2016",1

Marketing Analytics,University of Virginia,https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-market-analytics,uva-darden-market-analytics,"This is one of the most terrible courses on Coursera. Thank God I received it for free and wasted no more than 3 days. The instructor cannot impart knowledge well. The course itself is not meant for beginners. So be careful before wasting your time and (money). The presentation is sub-par. What the instructor writes and speaks can only be understood by him. Somehow you will be able to drag through two weeks of material. But when you reach the third week, you will realize that you have wasted your precious time. The formulas are just rushed through. And the new terms are not even explained before being introduced. If you are not fond of complex calculations, kindly opt-out. Don't believe me? Check out the discussion forums, the people there have no idea either. They just type random stuff to see what others are typing. The instructor's accent (Indian) makes it worse. And trust me, this review is coming from an Indian. I don't know what's it going to take for me to convince you, but the fact that it was pretty low on ratings on classcentral.com and other things should give you a clue. Also, I wouldn't waste so much time to convince you guys. It's not worth it, even for free! To be honest, this course makes a mockery out of Darden School of Business.

Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces,DeepLearning.AI,https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp,classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp,"This course has too many problems as it stands:1) They haven't chosen an audience: the concept that they explain are trivial for anyone having (even basic) machine learning (or even basic linear algebra) knowledge. However, it doesn't meant that this explanations would be useful for beginners: they are too short and incomplete (the ""videos"" are on average 3 minutes long!!) and what they focus on is often not the most relevant part.2) There is no reading material: no books, no papers, no theory. It wouldn't be a problem if the videos themselves were decent, but most of them are about 1 minute long. You can't explain machine learning in such a short time. 3) The code of the assignments, especially assignment 4, is unclean (e.g. unused variables) and contains minor bugs. 4) The script that grades the assignments has very strict requirements: as an example, very often, if you use x.dot(A) instead of np(x,A), then it complains and says you've failed. This happens for a lot of numpy functions, and it makes the process of submitting results tedious.5) Again, regarding the course material itself, many of the key aspects are not discussed.

The team of lecturers is very likeable and enthusiastic.

An age old unfunded theory presented as the sole work on the topic.If Psychology is a science, then this course is not about Psychology. It is merely a wikipedia level of content. I am disappointed, but more than that, worried that an influential Professor of Psychology is lacking awareness of his own biases and is spreading this around. Is there anyone ever checking the content of these courses or do we just give these Professors license to say what they want. Should we even care?

Many of the content could have been summarised to further expand the topics covered in the course. There is a missed opportunity because a lot of the course participants were highly engaged and gave quality assignments (not all courses have the same caliber of participants). The entire course feels like an introduction to an actual course that never came through. There were also videos that were repeated, transcripts that were doubled, and non-functioning links which reflects the overall lack of effort in generating this course. The Instructor Dr J. Simons  was mostly invisible and barely gave informative insights. He acted more like a panel discussion host. This is genuinely a missed-opportunity as surely Dr. Simons would have had bountiful information to share on the topic. After just completing a very good course from another university in coursera, I was very disappointed at the level that this course was made.

Child Nutrition and Cooking,Stanford University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition,childnutrition,"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you.  If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples).  I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk.  I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly.

Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!?

The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top.  If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.

Data Science Math Skills,Duke University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills,datasciencemathskills,"This course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science. It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept. 
Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com.
The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time.
In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct.
Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else.

But since you are in between the top rated courses either nobody uses Coursera anymore or people are silent enough and patient enough.You are all Scientists like me, I'm also biostatistician but I would never ever post a course like this to any platform. I'd rather use Google or Facebook ads to lead people here.If somebody wise enough to get Data Science Course, he should be skillful enough to download R, click next and install it, and R has help for it, shows you step by step. GitHub is free platform, anyone who can signup for Coursera can signup for GitHub, too.I know there is no requirements for this course or specialization course, it is 0 to Scientist but seriously you are talking about R codes, arrays, loops, regression, model fit but signing up for GitHub.Your target group in Coursera is either Data Scientist or becoming one, so they know what the Data Scientist job posts requires. It requires coding blind folded R/Python/Java/one of C family at least 2 of them, hopefully all of them. It requires SQL, MySQL, NoSQL, any kind of SQL or database solution mankind ever used.It requires Math, Statistics, Analytics, Algebra, Finance, Economics + all kinds of computational sciencesIt requires management, social relations, advertising, psychology, anthropology + rest of the social sciences.+++++ it requires LOGIC and NON-ARTIFICIAL HUMAN INTELLIGENCEso we are trying to be that guy, no need to show installing R or GitHub, I'm sure you will do it again doing rest of the Specialization.",By Tolga T,"Nov 24, 2018",1

An additional problem this overabundance of lecturers causes is that individual lecturers feel that they must tech something substantial. Unfortunately, this is not possible as an individual lecturer has around 20-30 minutes lecture time in total.

No real advantage compared to reading a book on that matter.I just took the ""Economics of Money and Banking course"", which is one of the best courses I ever attended (personally in class or online). There are other great courses on Coursera.

Introduction to Philosophy,The University of Edinburgh,https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy,philosophy,"I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little. The title of this course should have been ""An Introduction to Just a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."" And there are so few philosophers covered. However, the biggest problem was instructor Alasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged. He showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes. It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the ""why"" of everything! A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there.

Those ""supplemental readings?"" yeah 99% of those are links to wikipedias definition of the given subject. hope you weren't actually trying to learn or something.3. A wonderful collection of the most aggravatingly non-specific multiple choice quiz questions, in which any of the given answers are true, but they're looking for a specific solution for a nonspecific problem so good luck figuring that out.4. To compliment the non-specific quiz's they offer a fine selection of non-specific directions to writing assignments. only AFTER you submit your project are you able to find out what they are actually looking for. the most extreme example of this is in the final project directions, which one of my colleagues aptly described as ""cryptic""5. Do you like technical failures? cause they do! smash your face in frustration as the labs fail to grant write permissions to the hardrive you are supposed to be working on, your interactive tests gets garbled all over the screen, (and don't tell me that's a user error, I tried that test on 3 different OS's across 2 different machines) or random ""Analyzing Background"" messages flicker on and off the instructors face.But its no big deal, there's always time for a couple political propaganda videos or google product promotionTldr: everything I hate about google, condensed into one place.",By Joseph B,"Aug 06, 2018",1

The first two sections re-hash the same points over and over ""What is gamification? What is gamification not? for 30+ minutes and then section 2: ""What is gamification? What is gamification not?"" The course was, from the looks of it, filmed in 2008 and not update one bit since then, and therefore has a ton of outdated information, statistics, etc. They're always talking about things being ""new and emerging"" when, by now, they're from a prior decade. Gag me with a spoon. Why would I or anyone else pay $95 just to see the rest of this course when the first section or two of it is utterly incompetent except for referencing a few factoids about the concept of a game from ancient philosophers which anyone could Google to grasp the same concept of.

Introduction to HTML5,University of Michigan,https://www.coursera.org/learn/html,html,"The caliber of questions in the quizzes is quite advanced.  I would be fine with that, as the challenge of writing correct html5 is a good challenge. However much of these questions were not covered in the lectures or the required and optional reading. Learning the correct html tag syntax is not intuitive--one has to be shown examples.  If no examples have been covered, how can a quiz-taker be expected to create the proper tags?  This strikes me as bad pedagogy.  In order to answer the questions and prepare the requested page of html tags, it became necessary for a beginner such as me to research elsewhere in order to answer the questions.  In that case, I began wondering why I was taking this course, rather than just reviewing the many free html5 explanations on the Internet.  Further the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when I am simply told something isn't right and I should review the lessons--again.   I expected better feedback.I found this course to be fascinating from the lecture point of view, but ""abusive"" in terms of quiz expectations.

Data Analysis with Python,IBM,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python,data-analysis-with-python,"Honestly, I'm not sure why this course has such a high rating. I feel like it can't possibly be a reflection of what actual students felt about the course. Reading the other reviews, it's clear some of the issues people had with the course were not the course-designers fault. But,  there were some tissues that are simply inexcusable. For example, typos in the lectures (especially towards the final week) show little to no proofreading was done. A lot of the labs involved ""Warnings"" that the instructors didn't explain to students (and so obviously some students got confused by them, even though they were inconsequential). And the final peer-graded assignment was a complete mess. The first few questions are numbered Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, etc. But the last 4-5 questions are not numbered making it very annoying to upload screenshots for each question. The directions in the assignment were simply wrong. For example, one of the questions didn't even have a prompt, just an empty text box. Someone asked about it in the ""Discussions"" and a staff member replied but it was never fixed in the assignment.  Trying to put the typos and logistical confusion aside, the course material was oddly organized and students were never really given an explanation as to why the concepts taught were being taught in this way. My least enjoyed course of the whole specialization. ",By Laura M,"Jun 25, 2019",1
Project Planning,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-1,project-planning-1,"I found this course to be derivative of the Project Launch course. There was little value added and a lot of repetition throughout the course. There was also the issue of the quiz questions not being specifically covered in the course material. For instance, in the Agile week 6 it was obvious the test questions were copied from an agile specific course as many of the questions were not covered and terms not defined in the previous course material.To improve, I would recommend to combine the Project Launch and Project Planning courses, and make it an 8 week course. With the additional course, create a course entirely devoted to Agile PM as this is an entirely different mindset with a different vocabulary than traditional PM. ",By Lauren R,"Oct 19, 2017",1

Instructional Design Foundations and Applications,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.coursera.org/learn/instructional-design-foundations-applications,instructional-design-foundations-applications,"My opinion is
influenced by my professional experience as a classroom teacher, that
utilizes the Flip model and other non-traditional instructional
practices.  In teacher professional development we talk a lot about
“best practices” and how best to reach our students, and this
class just fails miserably in achieving “best practices”.

As a teacher, I’m
not completely ignorant when it comes to the content of this course. 
Weeks 3 and 4 covered content I am familiar with and/or have received
specialized training concerning those topics.  Weeks 1 and 2 were
largely new information and really just provided me with vocabulary
and structured thinking to many things that I do already.  Returning
to “best practices”, the entire course simply fails to
demonstrate the concepts it is teaching.  Using Gagne’s Nine Events
of Instruction, the instructors have failed to gain the attention of
their audience, and they fail to recognize the impact of their
presentation style on the attitudes – specifically motivation and
engagement – of the audience.  


I would like to
share a few recommendations with you.  First, the instructional video
format.  A rule with instructional videos is that you can expect
about 1 minute of attention for every grade level.  So for a 9th
grader, don’t make your videos longer than about 9 minutes.  There
is a point of diminishing returns.  Keep your videos short.  A thirty-minute instructional video is a bad idea in general.  Break the video
into multiple parts to make it “digestible”, and not overload the
learner.  The “talking heads” format that is utilized is not
engaging.  The slides have too much text; if the learner has to read
the slides, then they aren’t listening to you.  None of the
presenters are engaging in personality or delivery.  Dr. Huang may be
an expert in this field, but his videos are long, his voice is
monotone, and he just doesn’t have a presence on screen.  Nothing
about any of the presenters’ deliveries makes learning in
this course exciting.  


Required reading in
this course needs to be altered.  I could have purchased a book on
Amazon for $20 that covered the same content in fewer pages and
would focus more on practicality than straight up theory.  The week 3
required reading was “unreadable”.  You could get the same result
of your required readings by just giving students a bullet list of
topics and having them do their own Google Search of terms.  That
would at least be active learning.  


Assessment design in
this course is poor.  The discussion prompts in videos are a waste of
time as every student creates their own thread in the discussion
forum and there is no incentive to dig through responses to get other
people’s opinions or views because it is not referenced directly in
the summative assessments.  Question design in the quizzes should be
changed as well.  Multiple choice questions are one thing, but
multiple choice-multiple answer questions are cruel.  The later
quizzes are extremely difficult because of this as phrasing and
structuring of answers is not referenced directly from the videos. 
This requires content fluency from the learner that has not been
practiced, developed or assessed prior to this quiz, so the learner
is left guessing and hoping.  Thankfully, there are essentially
unlimited retakes.  


THIS IS REALLY
IMPORTANT.  At the beginning of the course it is stated that this
course is part of the MicroMasters program.  According to the course
listing for that program on CoursEra….it’s not.  


I WOULD STRONGLY
RECOMMEND using a couple of case studies that are introduced at the
beginning of the course and are examined throughout the course as
topics and methods are discussed.  Draw parallels; point out possible
errors; DEMONSTRATE what you are talking about.  


As a teacher, I
always strive for student engagement.  This is even discussed during
the course, attitude/motivation has a big influence on the success of
the learning experience.  Make the course more engaging.  Right now I
don’t plan to continue the MicroMasters program because the
experience thus far has been a soul-sucking/motivation-draining
experience AND I’m not convinced the instructors can provide me
with any information, methods, etc., that I’m not already familiar
with that will improve my skills in the development, implementation,
and evaluation of my learning resources.

This course relies mainly on PDF slides (if I wanted to read, I would've bought a book).  At one point, it even links to 6 articles on another website (and that's in the quiz as well).  It seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors.  The slides themselves seemed scatter-brained, several times asking questions that are never even answered.  It was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an ""online"" course.

I had come upto week 4. While Chris Impey is knowledgeable and good, the course structure is very poor and leaves  a lot to be desired. I would venture to make some suggestions:

a. Restrict each video to a max of 7 minutes. More than that makes one sleepy.

b. Reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say 6. 

c. Instead of having Chris expound it like an audio reading, please include some slides, pictures,tables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and Chris doesn't have to speak so much.  A good example is the Coursera ""The Global Financial Crisis"", which I am also doing currently.

d. If you feel all the material in this course has to be studied, then to achieve the objectives in (a) and (b) above, divide this course into two parts, Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space - part I & II.

e. The written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory. Can you make the questions more challenging? For example, in Telescopes (Assignment 2), can you not ask a question like ""In addition to Atacama, Chile, using Google earth, which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes?"" or ""To obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere, discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes?"" or ""What do you feel about the fact that since today's mobile phones have high computing ability, their components can be used to make a low-cost space based interferometric telescopes?""

Teamwork Skills: Communicating Effectively in Groups,University of Colorado Boulder,https://www.coursera.org/learn/teamwork-skills-effective-communication,teamwork-skills-effective-communication,"I found this course highly theoretical. It's probably a good course for those who study communication in college but it is NOT a course for professionals who want to learn new skills that can be applied to real life situations. The first two (out of four) modules were dedicated to theories of communication and a lot of definitions. The only useful moment was about what the stages a groups goes through when it is formed, which was probably 5 minutes of a lecture. The rest... Why do I need to know that holding on to an initial piece of information is called anchoring? And we don't just communicate but construct our reality through communication? These ideas are worth exploring through examples, or through practical tips on how they should be applied or avoided, or maybe through going deeper into them in assignments. However, the course just named them, the quizes made me go back to the theory because the questions were asking to give the definition to a term or to tell which term applies to a particular situation. As a student, I was left wondering what to do with this information.        ",By Maryna D,"May 23, 2020",1

I found myself skipping the videos and only reading the transcripts. It was quicker and made me realize there was nothing in any of the videos that made video a preferred medium to deliver content. Why sit through 5-15 minutes of someone talking/reading their notes when I could read the page and get more from it? What a waste.Beyond that, the peer grading of assignments was foolish. Some of the grades/feedback I got from peers showed they did not actually read my full response or pay attention to the question asked of us. One person even said it seemed I hadn't watched the video--even though I quoted directly from the video and responded to it. In a different assignment I brought in relevant links and details that I have found/used/learned in my work as a college professor already versed in digital learning, but my classmates gave me a failing grade.

Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau,"University of California, Davis",https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-tableau,data-visualization-tableau,"This course is terrible for many reasons. Firstly, the amount of content is ridiculously small - only about 20 minutes of video lectures per week. Moreover, more than 50% of content is just non-relevant. Secondly, practical assignments are very poorly planned: 1) in weeks 3 peer graded assignment students are asked to save Tableau workbooks as twbx files, even though this feature is not supported by Tableau Public that is used in this course. The assignment itself is just opening and saving file in Tableau. 2) in weeks 4 peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined 1 page description. It doesn't include any Tableau-related activities.Thirdly, quizzes are ambiguous and very general.Overall, this course is just a waste of time.

Introduction to Programming with MATLAB,Vanderbilt University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab,matlab,"This course was ultimately frustrating to take. There is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments. Using optional methods to complete this course, such as to use the textbook and forums, is too time consuming  (deciphering a text book) or insulting (forum mentor responses). To to solve the assignments, it usually involved trying to 1. refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or non-mathematician, 2. deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking, 3. scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture, 4. having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentors. The unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle. Even from the early week's lectures we learned about semantics, and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors, so I wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors. For example, in the final homework I had a simple mistake, but since we cannot show code, it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying ""we covered this already."" I'm well aware of what we covered, but if someone is stuck on a problem, there needs to be a much better way of helping that person. I did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me ""your logic is wrong"", and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignment.There probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now. Please fix the questions, stop using Project Euler, and let people directly message code to mentors. Will probably save time rather than try to blindly (and frustratingly) explain code over and over again. Ultimately, I felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding, or has no work to do other than to do this course, it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate.",By Vincent N,"Sep 26, 2016",1
Preparing to Manage Human Resources,University of Minnesota,https://www.coursera.org/learn/managing-human-resources,managing-human-resources,"First of all, I am so sorry I have to give a one-star review for this Human Resources lesson. Those lecturers are experts in the HR field, their lectures are clear and helpful. It is such a pleasure to learn from their lectures. The reason why I give a one-star rate is I believe Coursera's ""peer review"" assignment procedure is really problematic. ""Discussion section"" is supposed to be a place that all student share their ideas and experiences, however, it is filled with ""Please review my assignment and I will review back with the highest marks"" now. I totally understand why this happened now, due to the ""peer review"" procedure.For me, I have an assignment requires a minimum of 80% to pass the whole specialization. My first attempt got 77% and I thought ""Sure, there is definitely some improvement I can make"". My second attempt got 79% and guess what? I canceled the subscription and find a real book and some videos from youtube. I believe I can learn from CPHR's NKE materials as well.

I was drawn in by assumed time for completion. 4-8 hours/week sounded pretty good for the schedule of a working adult, however the 10-minute ""assignments"" consistently took me 6+ hours (most of the time spent calling/screen-sharing with my developer friend for help). Again, I think if one already has some programming knowledge (and therefore not *really* a 'beginner') then yes, this would probably take them that amount of time.

It is also about the sort of language the speakers choose - for example, on multiple occasions they divide the market into ""US"" and ""International"".

Teach English Now! Foundational Principles,Arizona State University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/english-principles,english-principles,"This course has great videos. I give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems. This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400. ",By Dorothy H,"Feb 04, 2016",1

It would be great to have the link to this research, so that we can, for example, compare the cost of productivity decline caused by homophobia with cost of anti-homophobia training. Without this proof the rest of the course loses its value and the whole existence of this course feels redundant - why should I spend a lot of my resources on getting opinions of random people about this topic if I can get it for free by googling relevant keywords?

Course Equivalence😐This course basically covers 50% content of MATH2411 Applied Statistics (I heard there is ISOM2500 that is similar to MATH2411?). Accidentally I took 2411 right before this winter when this course is out, so I found this course quite disappointing because I expect some practical manipulation of Python is covered while it doesn't. More is discussed in #3.

1. Teaching ☹If you have the experience of recording a video presentation eight hours before the deadline, with scripts written three days before and you hadn't recited or even gone through it in these three days, you will find the professor the same unpassionate. You will find his tone flat enough and gestures unnatural enough as if he is not emphasizing on anything but focusing to recite his scripts. You will find him lag a lot at strange and unnatural spots as if his brain goes blank and he quickly reads the copy of scripts next to the camera.

I thought business people cares a lot about presentation, but I was wrong.

2. Subtitle 😡There are tons of me steaks in the subtitles, not only tipos but also worlds of cellar pronunciation. 
(There are tons of mistakes in the subtitle, not only typos but also words of similar pronunciation.)

I enable subtitle because I sometimes can‘t understand the professor's perfect Mainland accent, but it turns out the subtitle is on his side but not my side. 

I thought business people are very strict about the material that comes along with their presentation, that they always carefully spellcheck every sentence. But I was wrong.

3. Content 😐3.1 Overall:
Please rename this course ""Python and applied statistics"". The professor spends sooooo much time talking about the statistics concepts and spends soooo little time applying the knowledge to financial analysis. It is not about ""Statistics for Financial Analysis"". Replace the data he uses for demonstration with GPA of every student and it becomes ""Statistics for Being HKUST President"" or ""Statistics for Anything"". I feel I am taking an introduction course to statistics and financial analysis is just an excuse the teacher use to show us the content he teaches is somewhat useful.

3.2 Pace:
You MAY find the pace quite fast because:
    The teacher throws many statistics concepts
    The teacher cannot fully explain the concepts (or it is not a 4 week course) so he moves on before you ever (perhaps never will) digest the previous concepts

This is extremely annoying in week 4, e.g. Multiple Linear Regression is taught without introducing a single formula, merely Python codes and black boxes behind them. (Actually this is the way I originally expect the professor to do, but it is quite inconsistent with the style in week 1-3)

You MAY find the pace quite slow because:
    After all this course introduces formulas and codes and let you to use them without knowing why. 

So I would say this is a 4-day course if you can spare 1 hour each day. After all you are not asked ""why"" but only ""how"". If you haven't taken MATH2411 or ISOM, you can spend more time on week 2 & 3 to understand the underlying knowledge. Week 1 is simple and week 4 is needless to comprehend.

4. Jupyter Notebook (JN for short) 😡4.1 Poor Exercise
Almost useless. Just a copy of the codes appeared in the video, with some variables assigned None instead of the correct expression. Your job is to change the lines of variable assignment (usually one or two lines), and the rest is done for you. Some notebooks are even 100% done for you, and all you need to do is look at it and appreciate. Even if you are fiddling with provided exercises, you don't know how to use JN, because...

4.2 Irresponsible adoption of JN
If you want to do some real exercise, you may want to append empty cells below the given content and type codes from scratch. But oh, this course does not teach you how to use JN! It just throw you a tutorial link of how to INSTALL JN ON YOUR COMPUTER{https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook}. What a shame!

Quickly gone through the linked tutorial, it assumes you have installed multiple instance of Python on your desktop, and know basics of pip, conda, docker, and virtual env, and teaches you how to install and configure JN in various dev. environments. But you just mentioned we can use Coursera's pre-installed JN out-of-the-box, why you want us to learn that huh? And to create cells, run cells, run several cells in order, run all, and other basic operations, is hidden in the last seconds of GIFs, not explicitly explained.
I guess the professor is TOO UNRESPONSIBLE to not only teach students how to use JN himself, but also SPEND AT LEAST SOME TIME to check if the external tutorial really ""explains how to use Jupyter Notebooks"". Please, not every one taking this course is CS student like me, SBM students they may not know how to use Python stuff.

5. Coursera Technical 😐Quizzes do not provide correct answer. So it is not that helpful. But getting 80% is not that hard either. But given the assumption that you can't use JN (explained in #4.), you lose at least 10% in Quiz 3 and 20% in Quiz 4. Oh that hurts! (Since Notebook 4.4 is done for you, another 20% in Quiz 4 related to JN is okay.)",By Zeyu H,"Jan 20, 2019",1

Just three or four teachers taught something as a well structured overview class. It is extremely focused on water and waste management: what about energy, soil, landuse, forestry, agriculture, urban planning, policies...?

The idea of having to PASS a PRE-ASSESSMENT before taking the course was so illogical that I ended up trying to pass that after I had finished the first week of classes. As for the exam questions, they were terrible. The questions did not ask the right things, they weren't questions about what certain commands do but about ""which grip options show up with poly lines or arcs?"" These questions are so useless and not what EDUCATION is about, it was extremely unhelpful to say the least.

Functional Programming Principles in Scala,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1,progfun1,As a Java programmer with some 18 years industry experience I quickly got lost on this course. It might not be the course - it could be me! It might be that I am too long in the tooth as an OO programmer that I cannot cope with the transition to functional programming.I found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me. But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water.  There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like. As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory. And I struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for real-world Scala programming either. I just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types!!! I could write a wrapper for Int in Java in 2 minutes. Doing this abstract Scala exercise would take me all day and I still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it! Whatever happened to maintainability principles ?I have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week 3 I might as well be doing a course in advanced Arabic. I cannot continue this course now because I cannot complete the exercises. I am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of Scala or the course or both.

Positive Psychology: Applications and Interventions,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/positive-psychology-applications,positive-psychology-applications,"For the ""Three good things"" exercise, I got a failing grade from peers, which i feel is not justified. I felt that ""sharing the experience applying the exercise"" was more
important than just listing the three things every day, but the peer that reviewed my assignment didn't agree. 
















I
didn't write down exactly what I said each day, though I did the exercise and
said so. I also had a personal reflection about the exercise, which I thought
through carefully, and which I felt really showed how I understood the purpose
of the exercise. I don't think it was expressly said clearly enough when the
assignment was set that all we needed to do was list the three things daily, and
talk about why they were good. I don't really think that that is the basis of
the exercise or the course, especially when I had a deeply personal reflection of the
exercise. If all we need to do is list things, then I think it's a useless
exercise, which doesn't really lead to personal insight. I could go back and
redo the assignment, just listing things, but I don't think that's a really
useful thing to do. 



Also, I
don't think it makes sense to explain why the good things happen each
day...they just happen, and we notice them! There is no ""why""...if we
notice a beautiful sunset, there is no ""reason"" to explain why it
happened. I wouldn't know what to say that would make a peer feel like I had a good ""reason"" to explain why the good things happened. If I need to go back and just make a silly list, and try to explain the inexplicable, just to pass the course, I will do so, but I don't feel that it really gets to the heart of what the exercise was attempting to have us realize and work through. The rest of the course has been wonderful, and I've really been enjoying it, this is the first thing that I'm not really happy with.Thank you, Elayne Ras

Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments,University of Colorado Boulder,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems,introduction-embedded-systems,"Completely ruined by the final assignment.This could have been a good course. While the lectures are presented at a whirlwind pace of cramming at least a full semester's worth of material into 4 weeks, and not at all for the feint of heart or those without a good solid background already in C and systems -- they are still really strong lectures. Fosdick's rapid-fire rat-a-tat lecturing style is mind bending to be sure, but the material is presented intelligently and articulately. The lectures slides are well-done and are provided for download (unfortunately in mixed formats: sometimes PowerPoint, sometimes pdf). And while the pace would be completely off-putting in a one-shot classroom environment, it is perhaps fitting for a video format where one can pause and rewind. Captions are a must, but unfortunately not all the videos have the right captions associated with them.While the lectures are generally solid, and the material presented is practical and challenging, the course suffers from a problem that seems to plague the discipline of electrical engineering almost universally. This problem is the fundamental lack in the instructor's ability to bridge the gap between theory based lectures and pragmatic application of this information.To be clear, there is a LOT of practical information supplied in the lectures. One only needs to be diligent and to view, review, and review again given the lecture style. However, there are numerous gaps between the information presented and the knowledge required to complete the assignments.This, as I've stated, is a general plague on the house of EE. I have seen this problem in nearly every EE course I have ever taken. By comparison, the same problem is largely conspicuously absent from the teaching culture of the field of CS (I have done a considerable amount of work in both fields). Even in areas where the two disciplines overlap, the pedagogical culture of computer science almost always trumps that of electrical engineering in the singular aim to TEACH.That all said, one who has a decent background in C programming and a decent systems-level understanding could quite successfully stumble through this material (with the caveat of planning to spend many more hours than the estimated commitment -- I spend 10+ hours per week on this course and have a considerable background in both systems and software). That is ... until the final assignment where it all falls apart. This assignment is, quite simply put, just plain lazy teaching. The assignment itself is a gross regurgitation of requirements that do little to support the ostensibly stated goals of the assignment itself. It is full of holes and ambiguities and contradictions. It would appear to be the case that the true intent of this assignment must be to weed out those who don't have the willingness to make a gargantuan commitment toward sorting out all the guesswork of what the professor REALLY wants. More likely, it's just a lazy effort, and reflects poorly on CU Boulder, Coursera, and the entirety of engineering education.Could have easily been a 5-star course with a decent focus on clarity and quality and emphasis on teaching rather than lazily falling into the mode of letting the students with the most dedication just figure it out for themselves.

Personal & Family Financial Planning,University of Florida,https://www.coursera.org/learn/family-planning,family-planning,"There are a number of reasons I'm quitting this course. 1) Lack of research and understanding of the subject material. This professor assumes that those without savings have spent recklessly in the past, and doesn't address the needs of some 50% of possible learners taking this course. In fact, I'd go far enough to say that the majority of people who would be taking a course on personal and family financial planning, are likely the sort of folks who would not have previously held financial stability. You can make an argument for why this might be, but evidence is that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck not by choice, but by economic design. As such, this content is dismissive, offensive, hurtful, and above all else, unhelpful to those who are looking to learn and strategize in spite of their financial situation.

Worst part is the absence of references whatsoever. Critiques to what they called neoclassical theory, which I suppose is the mainstream one, are based mainly on straw man.For example the lesson on households talks mainly about gender stereotypes, which of course are interesting, but then it really makes me wonder what the professor wanted to discuss. Second, and worst of all, with a completely cooked up example the professor claims neoclassical economics posits gender stereotypes are good for the economy, whereas with some other theory this is not true anymore. This is ludicrous at best. This is really not what economics is about. Look up for a course on history of economic thought instead.

Improving Communication Skills,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-communication-skills,wharton-communication-skills,"I felt that this course was mis-labeld or mis-advertised.  The purpose for which I took this course was to learn how to communicate better in business presentations.  The first part of this course seemed more like Social Psychology 101, and there was not very much effort to relate what the content was to a business environment.  The few examples that were there to give business context I felt were rather un-ethical and in my view promoted an unhealthy business attitude.  I didn't agree with the instructors points on a few things, most notably that threats are a valid option on a business environment.  In my opinion the use of threats is a last resort and should not be encouraged except in extreme circumstances.  And this was the longest lesson which makes it sounds like the most important part of the whole thing - which in my mind puts the focus of a business mindset in completely the wrong place.Overall, I found this course to be very basic and in some cases downright insulting and counter to my personal ethics.In re-reading the syllabus - I can see how it can be described like it is - however for the ""who should take this course "" section you need to add - people who want to understand the psycology of basic communication principles"" - for which this is probably a great course - but for myself - who have been in the business world for 20+ years and who was looking for some help tot get to the next level this was not it.",By tracy,"May 20, 2018",1
"Introduction to Trading, Machine Learning & GCP",New York Institute of Finance,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-trading-machine-learning-gcp,introduction-trading-machine-learning-gcp,"This course is a pre-sales demo of BigQuery. I thought GCP was partnering with the NY Institute of Finance to create the labs on VMs using GCP (which makes sense), but it turns out that the core information about the introduction to trading and ML is minimal, about 20 minutes of substance per week and the rest of the time is Google advertisement for BigQuery and GCP. The skewed theory from the videos ends up with a Google product guide of a specific, more skewed way of running a feature of a product. I thought this course would give me a proper introduction of ML for trading but instead is more focused on the google ecosystem. I would not recommend this course unless you want to learn more about Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, TensorFlow or any other google product. The NY Institute of Finance fails to deliver the theory, it seems like google is telling the instructor what to talk about so google can show and tell about its products.You are better off buying a good book about ML for trading and read the google documentation about the products they have (if you want to use google),  it'll be cheaper and more time effective.",By Carlo R C,"Jan 03, 2020",1
Python Programming: A Concise Introduction,Wesleyan University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction,python-programming-introduction,"I opened and started this course because I was searching for a Python courses. I somehow misunderstood the fact that this course is for ""beginner programmers"" and not ""beginners in Python"" (could be just simply me, I am new to Coursera). I am already a skilled programmer with more than 10 years of commercial practice. And I have some reasons to review this course poorly. If I'd be a beginner programmer, this course is not bringing some real life problems and not explaining their solutions and how to solve it in computer program. Such an example is crucial for beginner programmers. Padding output in a string with spaces is just a waste of time. Implementing a console program with menu in infinite loop and reading from and writing to a CSV file, which is called a ""database"", was fancy maybe 20 years ago. I don't think this course is teaching much about Python nor is bringing a beginner programmer any further. It's 21st century, IT world is full of millions of technologies, and pure Python is not going to help in real life on it's own. Explaining more about data structures, some basic but important programming principles, involving a real database for data persistence, some real life problems and their solutions, even if one or two more weeks would be needed to finish the course, and it could get on a completely different level.",By Peter K,"Dec 10, 2017",1

It's fine the the instructor only uses one of them, but he does not specify what conditions he enforced, even if you used the mean-square sense ergodic, you should SAY it!!2) A lot of repeating lectures. e.g. week7.2 lectures, half of it repeated the proof of ""K(s,t) continuous iff K(s,t) continuous along the diagonal"" this is identical the lecture 6.4 properties of covariance function.3) a lot of errors in homework questions! Even in questions in each video... Not just one, but a ton of them. Please, there are only 6 questions in a quiz and 5 of them have wrong answers... It could only tell how sloppy or how incapable the instructor is 4) As for the content, it is really just an introductory course. If the purpose was to introduce topics in stochastic processes, can you please at least state the definitions correctly and clearly? If the purpose was to focus on one of the most important stochastic process -- Brownian Motion, there isn't any important part emphasized in the course, even not a proof from Random walk to 1-d Brownian motion... 5) The last thing (just my complaint), is that the pen he used is really squeaky...errrrrr",By tau,"Jun 19, 2018",1

The Technology of Music Production,Berklee College of Music,https://www.coursera.org/learn/technology-of-music-production,technology-of-music-production,"I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading.  I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).  To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention ""Prezi"" is subscription service.  I didn't use it.  Try Open Office which has a ""PowerPoint"" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs.  There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions).  You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.e. sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the ""suggested"" programs I tried.  The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke.  Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed. It is not.There is almost no practical discussion.  There's plenty of ""what,"" --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much ""how"" or ""why.""Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals.  If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you.  There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation.  If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.  So, who is this course for?  I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that.  If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much ""how.""  If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video). In the end, this course was very much a ""self teaching"" course.  I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like ""ADSR.""  I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, ""Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."" Rarely did it include ""how and why"" to use that XYZ for musicality. The quizzes were awful as well. There's a lot of ""minutia"" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed.  Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.  Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one.  This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do.  I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.I'm glad this is over. I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes.  Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.",By Jay M,"Mar 28, 2017",2

Object-Oriented Design,University of Alberta,https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design,object-oriented-design,"Even when videos are OK, there are a lot of issues on this course:1 - Even when they states in the course intro that ""You will be challenged in the capstone project to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting a Java codebase with corresponding UML documentation."", reality shows that you will earn a certificate only if you are able to develop  in Android language, what it was far, very far from my interest when enrolled. if I had known I had to develop on Android I would not have enrolled, and I am wondering the reason why they did not remark that on the course intro to avoid any confusion.2 - You are evaluated from other learners so, at the end, in case of doubt you will never be sure if you are right or the learner that is evaluating you is as wrong as you. There are no videos explaining proposed solutions so you will die in doubts if it is the case.3 - However, they can solve points 1 and 2 by keeping instructors participating actively in forums helping and guiding learners (in fact, this is the reason why I have paid for the course) but the reality is that the instructors are near to ""invisible"" and a lot of questions remains unanswered.For these reasons I feel totally cheated and will not try to finish the course and will lost my money.if I wanted to learn android I would have signed up for a course on that subject and not in a UML design course.My intention was to enrol me in the whole certification but I have realised that all the courses are Android based (and none of the them inform about such requirement) and after suffer the lack of help from instructors I will not enrol (or at least I will no pay) for them.",By Javier L,"Oct 16, 2017",1
Introduction to Intellectual Property,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-intellectual-property,introduction-intellectual-property,"peer reviewed final exam was a damn joke. 1. the clear parameters of the grading ""rubric"" were not disclosed prior to my writing and submission of my final exam. 2. as if the random peer that graded my exam was not flunking the class. Which means i got graded by someone who didnt even know the subject. 3. The person that ended up grading my exam was NOT MY PEER. Appeared to be a female living in Africa. Could not have been further from being a peer of mine. 4. There was an entire forum of ""grade me easy and i'll grade you easy"". IE a corrupt buddy system that wasnt even a true measure of anything i might have learned in the class. 5. Overall the grading stalled and appeared to be a tactic to push me over the time limit so i had my credit card was charged again for simple ""time on the clock"" vs controlling my own destiny as was with the deceptive start of the course. 6. When i finally complained i was IMMEDIATELY PASSED and GIVEN my certificate. Any benefit this course series might have offered has been completely obliterated by the laziness and deception of the course organizers. Disappointment doesnt even begin to define how i feel regarding this course, coursera.org, Penn Law and the professor that taught this course.

Big History: Connecting Knowledge,Macquarie University,https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-history,big-history,"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view. Furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",By Kerstin S,"Sep 18, 2016",1

The second week only teaches you basic middle school mathematics and in the last week, there are partly no video lectures because the content is too outdated and partly there are video lectures in a bad quality. Each video is not very long, but there is at least a 
minute only music intro and outro. No support by teachers with technical questions on QGIS, I watched a youtube tutorial in the end. Gave me an overview though, on what I still need to study to work in public health.

I totally understand why this happened now, due to the ""peer review"" procedure.For me, I have an assignment requires a minimum of 80% to pass the whole specialization. My first attempt got 77% and I thought ""Sure, there is definitely some improvement I can make"". My second attempt got 79% and guess what?

C for Everyone: Programming Fundamentals,"University of California, Santa Cruz",https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-for-everyone,c-for-everyone,"I stopped this course at Week 1, as I found various reasons to do so. It is a very pour course, as it is very confusing what level the student should be. The lecturer just goes through some slides and just explains what happens in every line of a program, without giving any context to the actual C programming language. His explanations are most of the time confusing and do not really add any useful information. Some explanations he gives are really cryptic (""Passing the address of an int &int"" without giving any explanation on what this really means. The course is set as Beginner level). His tone and flow of speaking is really poor for a lecture (I had to make the video at x1.5 rate and it was feeling that he was speaking normally at that rate. Imagine how slow he speaks). Finally, the slides and presentations are one of the worst i came across into a lecture. He has hand written slides, which shows a C program. His hand writting is really messy, resembling that of a doctor. I doubt anyone can really decipher the programs he is showing. The least i would expect from a course, is for the slides to be informative, neat and well written, rather than a bunch of hand written programs put into a screen. I wouldn't recommend this course to anybody (either beginner or intermediate), better just spend a week reading ""The C Programming Language"" by Dennis Richie.",By Nikolaos K,"Jan 05, 2020",1

Reference links to musictheory.net are nice, but equally superficial.  Time signature pedagogy is, bluntly, awful.  It is one thing to state a signature and explain them at the most superficial level,  and then a terrible failing when there is no robust discussion of how to read those signatures within the note pattern (as opposed to from the explicit signature.)  This is not a course appropriate for one without meaningful (e.g., not beginner) training.  Money wasted is one thing, having one's time wasted is clearly another as time is the one commodity we cannot replace and never have enough of. There are some errors in the exam questions too.

I flagged some specific problems, but there were flagrant transcriptionerrors on every single topic, so they really need a thorough review.The material in the course was quite outdated, and seemed to be of 2017–2018 vintage. There are several GCP product naming and functionality changes that affect the material. For example, an exam question asks which product is best used for sending GCS objects to Cloud Functions, whereas the two products can now talk directly to each other.The voiceover narration was frustrating and hard to follow. It is obvious the narrator was reading from an autocue with no separation between headings, paragraphs, or sections. The whole thing did not logically flow. He would be explaining a concept, and there would be random strange sentences which didn't feel like they belong, and only much later realised he was reading out random parts of the slide in a non-logical manner.Many of the practice sections (in the middle of a talk, it would pause and ask me to consider my answer), however the pauses and prompts were placed in the wrong area. For example, it would tell me the answer, and at the end of the answers, would ask me to consider what the answer would be right after it told me. This is likely a transcription error on the part of the person inputting the data into the course, but it really detracted from the learning experience.Overall I think the course was not worth my time.

Developing Your Musicianship,Berklee College of Music,https://www.coursera.org/learn/develop-your-musicianship,develop-your-musicianship,"The course materials are well done, but unless you pay for the class, you have difficulties completing material week to week.

There is a workaround it, which is tedious and time-consuming (you have to redo information from the prior week) and not where I want to spend my time.  Other classes allow you to audit the class, even take multiple choice quizzes (which can be machine graded), without being ""pushed"" to pay for the class.There were also times it was impossible to log into the class due to a slow system.

Introduction to Operations Management,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-operations,wharton-operations,"I understand that if you're reading this, it's probably already too late, but if not, I'd strongly advise that you research better opportunities to learn this material. First, the presentation is poor. This feels like it would be a state of the art course in 2007, but is very archaic now. The powerpoints are sloppy, there's no editorial oversight, the audio quality is very bad, and it is harder to focus than it needs to be. They need the instructor from the Corporate Finance course to come in here and teach this team how to make a powerpoint that's legible. Second, which is a problem I've had with other Coursera Wharton products, is the disconnect between the lectures, the practice, and the assignments. Things are left out or left to your own intuition, and you're on your own. The discussion forums are a great idea, but are totally neutered by the Coursera Honor Code which forbids students from discussing the assignments in any real detail. The Mentors are largely useless due to this limitation. This course should take note from the Financial Accounting course, which was similar in difficulty but worked you through every step of every possible problem type, and met you with challenging but doable assignments. Third, is basic quality control. There are typos, self-contradicting statements, etc., that have remained unfixed in this material over the course of years (lectures are six years old I've gleaned). I'm astounded that Wharton is willing to put its brand name on a packaged product of this quality. Ironically enough, you're often sitting through a lecture about process integrity and quality assurance-related topics. In sum, my experience in this course was mainly fighting against the class itself, not the material. Trying to figure out what the question means, what it's asking, rather than doing the math or remembering whatever function or logical process. It's really disappointing to have spent all this time on this course and the Business Foundations certificate program, when the utility per hour is so very very low. A complete rework is in order, if for no other reason than to get the instructor a new mic and have some grad assistant put together a nice sharp powerpoint instead of forcing students to read chicken scratches (which don't remain on the slides, so you better take really fast notes!)",By Nicholas J C,"Mar 13, 2019",1

Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach,University of Washington,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations,ml-foundations,"The materials used in this course are extremely outdated.

The data should be provided as .txt or .csv to be more universal. The instructors claim that you don't have to use a specific library to do this course, but you have to have at least SFrame in order to access the data! Further I am sure SFrame and Graphlab are good tools, but the course should be taught with open source tools so that the students can continue to use those tools after the course is over. I wanted to like this course.

Accounting Analytics,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-analytics,accounting-analytics,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations.  Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course.  Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content.  I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching.  If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating.  Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating.  But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy.  You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost.  Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through.  While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching.  And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers.  I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher.  There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here.  ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants.  These segments add absolutely zero value.  They lengthen the time of the course.  To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.",By Nick S,"Apr 26, 2017",1

First, this course is advertised as English but majority of the material is French with English subtitles. Subtitles are fine, but the problem with this material is that not all things are translated - so the speakers are translated but the diagrams/charts/powerpoint slides are all in French. I am fine with using a right-click on chrome for google translation, but this does not work for the pictures which contain French text.Also, the material, while very interesting, is very outdated. I don't know when this course was designed, but most of the material's diagrams and statistics are from 2012-2014. They project how perceptions of Europe might be for the future, but the ""future"" for this course is 2016, which is 4 years ago now. I don't think it it fair to pay for a course where the facts and figures don't even hold validity while I am taking it. I wanted to learn about the geopolitics of Europe today, not the geopolitics of Europe from 2014. I think there is a major gap of important material here.Overall, the course material was interesting, but definitely not what I was hoping for.

Понятно, что в гугл не забанили, но курс за 80$ в месяц с перечислением тем для изучения в другом более бесплатном месте за гранью здравого смысла.",By Lena D,"Jun 03, 2017",1

Hypothesis-Driven Development,University of Virginia,https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-agile-testing,uva-darden-agile-testing,Get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research. For being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the videos of the course are not a great help.,By Ico R R,"Dec 15, 2016",1
Accounting Data Analytics with Python,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accounting-data-analytics-python,accounting-data-analytics-python,"I enjoyed the course overall and finished, but feel like it could be soooo much better. Really a wasted opportunity here. The video explanations were solid, but not near detailed enough to feel comfortable doing the exercises. Many of the Jupyter notebook sections were simply a lot of reading, no chances for the students to get some hands-on experience with actual coding. And lack of instruction plagued too many the exercises. This could be an outstanding course if more time was spent on going over more of the content in greater detail and building out the exercises.

Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy,University of Manchester   ,https://www.coursera.org/learn/spectroscopy,spectroscopy,"I did not enjoy this course at all. It comprised nothing more than giving commentary of a presentation. A lot of the quizzes had errors in display, where instead of displaying options it gave the message ""Math not terminated in box"", hiding the actual content. The course felt very shallow and nothing was done in depth. I feel like many youtube videos do the job better than this. The worst part by far was the instructors voice. It was incredibly harsh and disturbing and off-setting. The audio quality was abysmal and there was no video narration. I found myself not wanting to complete the course only because of the way the professor spoke. The only slightly redeeming quality of this course were the tests where I got solve a lab spectroscopy problem. Please do not give this course, you will not enjoy it. Try looking for other similar courses, and you will learn spectroscopy better.",By Ameya K,"Aug 10, 2020",1
Managing as a Coach,"University of California, Davis",https://www.coursera.org/learn/managing-as-a-coach,managing-as-a-coach,"While the Facilitator may be knowledgeable, the course has a HORRIBLE format.  The Facilitator often giggles during the presentation which MIGHT work if this was a LIVE presentation.  Also she uses of the phrase ""a lot"" frequently and that detracts greatly from the value of the course.Introductory portions are poorly produced with background music that is louder than the Facilitator.  The course CONTENT is good, and is very helpful.",By Michael B,"Aug 13, 2018",1
