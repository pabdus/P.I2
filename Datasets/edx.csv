In this first course, you'll learn how individual neurons use electricity to transmit information. You'll build a neuron, piece by piece, using interactive simulations, then travel around Harvard's campus, where you'll see the inner workings of a lab and learn how to conduct DIY neuroscience experiments on your own. Join us as we study the electrical properties in individual neurons, building a foundation for understanding the function of the entire nervous system.","Lesson1: The Resting Potential
The nervous system functions by sending electrical signals between neurons. To begin our study of the nervous system, we will focus on a single neuron 'at rest,' which has an electrical potential across its membrane. We will understand the ionic basis underlying this electrical potential, and how to calculate it ourselves. Lesson 2: Passive Membrane Properties
Electrical signals between neurons can be sent through changes in their membrane potentials. In order to more deeply understand these electrical signals, we will first study the electrical properties of the neuron itself. We will examine the resistive and capacitive properties of the neuron, how these properties arise from biological factors, and how these properties influence how a neuron responds to electrical signals. Lesson3: Action Potentials
In this lesson we will investigate one of the fundamental ways that neurons send electrical signals, through an all-or-nothing process called the action potential. The action potential is generated by the precise opening and closing of voltage-gated channels that cause specific changes to the neuron's membrane potential. We'll develop an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of these channels and the ionic currents behind the action potential. Lesson 4: Action Potential Propagation
Neurons send electrical signals through action potentials moving down their axons. In order to further develop our understanding of the way neurons generate and send electrical signals, we will integrate our knowledge of the electrical properties of the neuron and the action potential itself. This will allos us to understand how the nervous system has solved the problem of fast and reliable communication. Lesson 5: DIY Labs
Seeing or measuring something with your own hands is often the best way to learn! We've spent a lot of time discussing the electrical properties of neurons, and along the way you've seen many different demonstrations. You can perform some of these experiments, as well as others we haven't shown yet, yourself, using an inexpensive piece of equipment known as a SpikerBox.",https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-1-the-electrical

If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.

In this course, we examine how neurons pass signals to one another and how complex dynamics can result from just a few neurons arranged in relatively simple circuits. Continue your journey through our Fundamentals of Neuroscience series with animations that explore the richness and complexity of the brain, documentaries about working labs around Cambridge. Join us as we use virtual labs that simulate neuron circuitry as we investigate the collective behavior of neurons and learn how the brain modulates the signals in those networks.","Neurons in isolation are fascinating and complex, but the real magic of neuroscience becomes manifest when we consider how neurons interact with one another. In this module, we examine how neurons pass signals to one another, and we explore how complex dynamics can result from even small numbers of neurons arranged in relatively simple circuits.
Lesson1: The Synapse
The junctions between neurons, called synapses, allow information to pass from one neuron to another. In lesson 1 “The Synapse,” we explore what synapses are made of, and how they work. Lesson 2: Excitation & Inhibition
Synapses can be grouped into two categories: synapses that increase the activity of the postsynaptic neuron are called excitatory synapses, while those that decrease its activity are called inhibitory synapses. In lesson 2 “Excitation & Inhibition,” we discuss the main differences between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Lesson 3: Small Circuits
Neurons combine information from many synapses at once in a process known as synaptic integration. In lesson 3 “Small Circuits,” we explore how a neuron integrates information from multiple synapses over time to allow complex signaling. Lesson 4: Neuromodulation
How many components are there in a synapse? You may think that the answer is simple: two, the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals. In lesson 4 “Neuromodulation,” we’ll see that this is not entirely true: the strength of many synapses is directly influenced by a third neuron, in a process called neuromodulation. Lesson 5: Potentiation & DepressionOne of the most amazing properties of the nervous system is its ability to adapt and change in the face of a changing environment, a phenomenon called ""neuronal plasticity."" Lesson 5, “Potentiation and Depression,” focuses on how neuronal plasticity occurs in the brain, and how it shapes the way we think and behave.",https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-2-neurons-and-ne

In this module, we will look at the brain from a human-centric viewpoint, exploring how the various subsystems of the brain work, enabling us to survive and thrive in a changing world. Lesson 1: Vision
One of the most developed senses in humans is our vision. In lesson 1, “Vision,” we take a deep dive into the visual system. How do we see, and more importantly, how do we understand what we see? Lesson 2: Audition
One of the many ways we communicate with one another and create community is through sound. In lesson 2, “Audition,” we will go on a journey that follows the path of sound waves as they are detected in the ear and processed in the brain. Lesson 3: Touch, Taste, Smell, and the Remaining Senses
There are more than just five senses in the animal kingdom. Consider eels with their ability to sense electric fields or vampire bats that can track down prey via infrared detection. In lesson 3, “Touch, Taste, Smell, and the Remaining Senses,” we explore both the remaining traditional senses - touch, taste, and smell - as well as some of the more unusual ones. Lesson 4: Movement and Action
Perceiving the world is useless if we cannot act. The motor subsystems of the brain execute and coordinate our movement. In lesson 4, “Movement and Action,” we discuss how the nervous system makes your muscles contract in a coordinated manner, so that you can move and interact with your surroundings. Lesson 5: Subcortical Brain Areas
While a highly-developed cortex is one of the key hallmarks of humanity, there's quite a bit more to the brain than cortex. In lesson 5, “Subcortical Brain Areas,” we explore the critical brain systems that keep us alive, help us orient to stimuli in our environment, and allow us to form new memories. Lesson 6: Brain Anatomy
In the last lesson of this course, “Brain Anatomy,” we wrap up our investigation of the brain with a closer look at the structures found in the sensory and motor systems in a real human brain.",https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-neuroscience-part-3-the-brain

How do we describe food texture? In the firstmodule of the course, we will explore the scientific concept of elasticity, which influences the texture of food, and how it changes during cooking. Discussions with Bill Yosses and Mark Ladner will address the role of gluten in dough and the challenges of working with gluten-free varieties. Module2: Viscosity
How can we make liquid foods more appealing? Just as solid foods can have different textures, so can liquids, largely determined by their viscosity, or thickness. Scientific discussions about what determines viscosity and demonstrations of different ways to change the viscosities of foods will allow us to explore this topic from different perspectives. We will hear from Harvard’s own Martin Breslin, Director for Culinary Operations, and Carles Tejedor, from Oillab and By restaurant in Barcelona. Module3: Emulsions and Foams
Emulsions and foams are some of the most interesting foods to think about from a scientific perspective, and we will investigate the physical principles that control their formation. Nandu Jubany will demonstrate how he uses emulsions and foams for a twist on traditional Catalan cuisine at his restaurant, Can Jubany. In the lab you can compete with other learners to see whose emulsion and foam rises the highest! Module4: Advanced Phase Behavior
The preparation of chocolate and frozen desserts such as ice cream are great illustrations of how chefs manipulate phase changes such as crystallization (freezing).In this module, we will discuss such concepts as nucleation of crystals and freezing point depression, and see how they can be used for chocolate tempering and making ice cream, which you will make yourself in the lab! Module5: Enzymes
The activity of enzymes can provide both benefits and challenges in the kitchen. After discussing the diverse roles that enzymes can play, we will investigate strategies to both restrict and exploit enzyme activity in cooking.

MalariaX: Defeating Malaria from the Genes to the Globe,"How can we eradicate malaria? Explore cutting-edge science and technology, and examine policies needed, to control and eliminate malaria.",37598,Self-paced on your time,Harvard University,Marcia Castro-Flaminia Catteruccia-Michael R. Reich-Marcel Tanner,Intermediate,Biology & Life Sciences,English,"English, Français",3–5 hours per week,8 Weeks,49,"How can we eradicate malaria? Explore the scientific and technological underpinnings of malaria, as well as the historical, political, social, and economic contexts in which control, elimination, and eradication efforts unfold.Through foundational lectures and supplemental interviews, this course provides participants with a toolbox of knowledge and skills. Learners will be guided through the analysis of real-world data and its effective use in problem-solving. Analytical approaches focus on how to develop and implement evidence-based intervention strategies to contribute to national and local malaria eradication efforts.The target audience for the course includes those with an interest in gaining the technical expertise and leadership skills needed to work in global health and malaria programs around the world.The self-paced nature of the course will allow learners to access it at their convenience.","Module 1: Setting the Stage for Malaria Elimination
The course begins with the “big picture.” In the lecture, Dr. Pedro Alonso, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Malaria Programme, offers an overview of the progress made—as well as challenges encountered – in malaria control and towards malaria elimination over the past decade. The module contextualizes these trends in WHO’s ongoing transition from promoting a one-size-fits-all strategy to tailoring approaches according to local and regional epidemiological, environmental, and political contexts.  Module 2: The Biology of Malaria
This module provides foundational scientific knowledge for the course, including important biological aspects of the malaria parasite, the mosquito vector, and the human host. In this module’s lecture, Professor Dyann F. Wirth begins with a brief overview of how malaria came to be understood, then goes into detail on the parasite’s life cycle, how malaria affects humans, and the existing and sought-after tools to prevent and treat malaria. Finally, Professor Wirth reviews global endeavors to eradicate malaria.  Module 3: Vector Biology and the Dynamics of Malaria Transmission
This module focuses on the Anopheles mosquitoes that are the vector that transmit malaria to humans. Professor Flaminia Catteruccia discusses biological and anatomical features of mosquitoes that influence how the parasite is acquired from humans, develops in the mosquito, and is transmitted back to humans. Professor Catteruccia then discusses how current vector control strategies work, why they fail, and how improved understanding of vector biology can lead to improved vector and parasite control strategies.   Module 4: The Dynamics of Malaria Transmission
In the fourth module, the course delves deeper into the malaria transmission cycle, including how it can be interrupted. Professor Matthias Marti examines the cycle of malaria parasite transmission between humans and mosquitoes, including mechanisms of parasite sequestration in the human body, and the life cycle of the parasite in the mosquito. The module then applies these concepts to examine the dynamics of infectiousness and transmission. Finally, natural transmission-blocking mechanisms are considered in the context of the ongoing development of vaccines against malaria.  Module 5: Genomic Approaches to Malaria Elimination
This course module introduces learners to the contributions of the burgeoning field of genomics to understanding and controlling malaria. After introducing key genetic principles, Dr. Sarah Volkman uses data on genetics from Senegal, Panama, and Mozambique to describe how parasite populations are changing. Currently available genomic tools and methods, along with their application to inform key questions about malaria transmission, prevention, and treatment, are discussed.  Module 6: Social, Cultural, Behavioral, and Environmental Determinants of Malaria
In the sixth module, the course’s focus shifts from the microscopic genes to a more global perspective. Using a systemic view of malaria, the module describes human and environmental factors that influence how malaria is manifested and how control efforts work. Professor Marcia Castro discusses various components of global ‘systems’ that enable the continued existence of malaria, and presents historical examples that exemplify the importance of these components. Professor Castro also describes the challenges and the opportunities in the struggle to eradicate malaria that these human and environmental factors create.  Module 7: Political Analysis for Malaria
In this module, the course presents another analytical approach that has been repeatedly shown to be necessary for successful malaria programming, as well as for public health more broadly. Professor Michael R. Reich approaches the topic of malaria control and eradication policy from the realm of politics. This module provides overviews of principles of applied political analysis and analysis methods that can be used to promote appropriate policy reforms. Professor Reich walks through the use of PolicyMaker, a free open-source political analysis software, analyzing case studies including one on the Affordable Medicines for Malaria Facility (AMFm).  Module 8: Malaria Control and Elimination: Surveillance-Response Approaches
This module discusses disease surveillance, a health system function essential to malaria elimination. Surveillance—finding where and when transmission of infectious diseases takes place—is critical for deciding where to target public health actions. In the lecture, Professor Marcel Tanner provides an in-depth examination of how to use monitoring and evaluation (M&E), surveillance-response, and data analysis effectively for malaria control and elimination. Using case studies from Zambia, China, the Pacific Islands and Tanzania, the module provides practical guidance on developing surveillance-response approaches and discusses how surveillance systems can be incorporated into public health programs.",https://www.edx.org/course/malariax-defeating-malaria-from-the-genes-to-the-g

American Government: Constitutional Foundations,Learn how early American politics informed the U.S. Constitution and why its promise of liberty and equality has yet to be fully realized.,35504,Self-paced on your time,Harvard University,Thomas E. Patterson,Introductory,Social Sciences,English,English,2–4 hours per week,4 Weeks,49,"“We the People” are the opening words of the U.S. Constitution, yet the original document did not give citizens much say in the election of their officials. Though some of those issues have been addressed, substantial barriers—gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws—still restrain the power of the vote. Why? How can a country, founded more than 200 years ago on the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism, still struggle to empower all of its citizens equally? This course explores the origins of U.S. political culture, how that culture informed the Constitution, and how that framework continues to influence the country’s politics and policies. We will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government, the division of power between the federal and state governments, and the forces that have made federalism a source of political conflict and change. We will address how the Constitution not only established the structure of the U.S. government but guarantees personal freedoms and civil rights. These rights have been challenged and expanded in significant Supreme Court cases, which will help to illustrate how historically disadvantaged groups have struggled to realize the 14th Amendment's promise of equality.","Week 1: Political Culture
This session will explore the origins of the nation’s political culture, its embrace by each succeeding generation of Americans, and its continuing influence on the nation’s politics and policies. U.S. welfare and education policy will be used to illustrate that influence. The session also highlights the nature of politics—the process through which society settles its conflicts over scarce resources and conflicting values. Week 2:Limited Government
This session will examine the Constitution’s provisions for limited government and then explore the extent to which these provisions have curbed constitutional abuses of power. The main points of the session will be reinforced by examining a set of cases, including the Watergate scandal, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the Bush Administration’s handling of enemy detainees after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Week 3:Representative Government
This session will explore the reasons that the framers felt it necessary to limit popular influence, will describe how and why the original system changed, and will look at contemporary barriers—gerrymandering, voter registration, and voter ID laws—that inhibit voting. Week 4: Federalism
The session will explain the division of power between the federal and state governments and also explain how broadly worded constitutional clauses, partisan differences, and changing national needs have combined to make federalism a source of political conflict and change. Among the cases explored in this session is the constitutional dispute provoked by the 2010 healthcare reform act. Week 5:Civil Liberties
This session will examine these developments and explain the individual rights held by today’s Americans. Major Supreme Court rulings—such as those relating to free speech and protection from unreasonable search and seizure—will be discussed as a means of clarifying Americans’ civil liberties. Week 6: Civil Rights
This session will focus on three policies that have been instrumental in expanding the rights and opportunities of disadvantaged groups: the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and affirmative action. The last of these policies have been particularly contentious and we’ll take a close look at it, including a recent Supreme Court ruling on a case involving the University of Texas at Austin.",https://www.edx.org/course/american-government-constitutional-foundations

But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeare’s time? Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt guides learners through an exploration of the Ghost’s uncanny theatrical power and the historical contexts from which the character emerged. You will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and how the Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. By focusing on the Ghost, you will see how the play grapples with issues like death, mourning, remembrance, and the power of theatre.

Patterson,Introductory,Social Sciences,English,English,2–4 hours per week,4 Weeks,49,"Public opinion has a powerful yet inexact influence on elected officials. Politicians risk their careers if they ignore it, yet its power is not easy to capture nor quantify. This course will look at how political parties, campaigns, social movements, special interests, and the news media all play a role in influencing public opinion. We’ll examine the attributes of public opinion, how polling attempts to measure those attributes, and how they impact the decisions of policymakers. We’ll address the unique features of the two-party system in the U.S., how those parties realign themselves in response to shifting norms, and how their candidates are vetted behind the scenes before the start of a campaign. Outside of the formal organization of party politics, groups representing various interests aim to affect a change through the political system. Special interest groups resemble political parties, but while parties try to influence elections, groups concentrate on gaining influence over policies. Meanwhile, social movements take place outside these established institutions, often in the form of protest demonstrations and rallies. All of these interests are filtered through the news media, which plays a critical role in shaping people’s images of politics. This course will help you to understand how these forces shape American politics, from “invisible primaries” to election day and beyond.","Week 1: Public Opinion
This session will examine the attributes of public opinion and explore its impact on the decisions of policymakers—a subject that has been closely studied by political scientists.We will also explain the theory and practice of polling, which has become the primary method of assessing public opinion. Week 2: Political Parties
Unlike most democracies, the United States has a two-party system, the Republicans and the Democrats. This session will examine this feature of the U.S. party system and will explain the nature of today’s Republican and Democratic parties. Party realignments will be a focus of the session. Week 3: Campaigns & Elections 
This session will begin with a look at the presidential nominating process, which includes what’s called the “invisible primary” along with the primaries and caucuses. The focus will then shift to the general election campaign, which centers on the battleground states—those that are competitive enough to be won by either candidate. Week 4: Political Movements
This session will examine the factors affecting the success of political movements, such as their ability to attract the resources required for sustained advocacy. Four cases will be used to illustrate the significance of these factors: the black civil rights movement, the Vietnam War protest movement, the Tea Party movement, and Occupy Wall Street. Week 5: Interest Groups
This session will examine interest groups, focusing on group influence and why some interests are more influential and fully organized than others. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, enacted in response to the economic downturn that began in 2008, will be used to illustrate key points about group influence. Week 6: News Media
This session will examine the news media’s influence on politics, focusing on the extraordinary changes that have taken place in the news system in recent decades and on the consequences of those changes. The U.S. news system was once dominated by the television broadcast networks and local newspapers. Today, they have to compete with cable and Internet outlets, many of which operate by a different standard. News coverage of Trump’s and Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaigns will be used to illustrate key points.",https://www.edx.org/course/citizen-politics-in-america-public-opinion-electio

Cities, nations, and empires from antiquity through the middle ages drew on foundational histories and myths for their identities, relating these narratives through generations by means of oral-storytelling and new writing technologies. These epics, story collections, and novels, which take a keen interest in heroic travelers, would eventually travel themselves, finding new global audiences as the first works of world literature. Tracing developments in language, writing, and literary genre, this course also travels in time, from legendary accounts of ancient kings to histories of medieval courts and early-modern exploration. We will stop to consider how all of these texts affected the history of their own eras, but also how they have continued to find new prominence and significance in ours.","Section 1: Introduction: What is World Literature?

Lodish-Zied Ben Chaouch,Intermediate,Business & Management,English,English,10–12 hours per week,16 Weeks,49,"This course focuses on early-stage biotechnology companies, with particular emphasis on understanding the underlying science, technology, and disease targets—together with the application of novel business structures and financing methods—to facilitate drug discovery, clinical development, and greater patient access to new therapies.Current research is enhancing our understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular bases of many human diseases, and is leading to many new types of biotherapeutics that we will cover in this course, including recombinant therapeutic proteins; monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates; cancer immunotherapies, replacement cells and genetically engineered cells; and nucleic acid and gene therapies. Translating these discoveries into drugs and diagnostics increasingly requires the establishment of for-profit companies, but funding for early-stage development of novel therapies is becoming scarcer, especially for therapeutics for “rare” diseases that affect small populations. The dearth of funding for early-stage biotherapeutics companies in the so-called “Valley of Death” can be attributed to several factors, but a common thread is increasing financial risks in the biopharma industry and greater uncertainty surrounding the scientific, medical, economic, political, and academic environments within the biomedical ecosystem. Increasing risk and uncertainty inevitably leads to an outflow of capital as investors and other stakeholders seek more attractive opportunities in other industries.By applying financial techniques such as portfolio theory, securitization, and derivative securities to biomedical contexts, more efficient business and funding structures can be developed to reduce financial risks, lower the cost of capital, and bring more life-saving therapies to patients faster. Thus this course will also cover basic financial analysis for the life-sciences professional; the historical financial risks and returns of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; the evaluation of the science and business potential as well as the mechanics of financing biotech startups; capital budgeting for biopharmaceutical companies; and applications of financial engineering in drug royalty investment companies, biomedical megafunds, drug approval swaps, and life sciences investment banking.","* Week 0:** Intro to the Science of Biotech and Healthcare Finance* Week 2:** AAV Vectors & In Vivo Gene Therapy; Capital Budgeting* Week 3:** Ex Vivo Gene Therapy; Stocks and Bonds* Week 4:** Nucleic Acid Therapies; The CAPM & Diversification* Week 5:** Gene Editing; Options* Week 6:** Clinical Trials* Week 8:** Monoclonal Antibodies; Securitization* Week 9:** Cancer Immunotherapeutic; Healthcare Analytics* Week 10:** New Cell Therapies; Pricing, Value & Ethics",https://www.edx.org/course/the-science-and-business-of-biotechnology

Despite their differences in size, power, culture, religion and ideologies, states rely on international law to cooperate and to coexist; they speak the language of international law and international law serves them as an important common language.This law course will extensively rely on judgments and advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).Having acquired a basic knowledge of international law, you'll find it easier to comprehend this subject in future international law sub-fields, like international human rights, international humanitarian law or international investment law.This course will teach you what international law is, the role it plays in the world today, how it can be used. You will also gain knowledge to help you better discern legal arguments within the flow of international news and reports.This course is part of the International Law MicroMasters Program that is designed to give learners a critical understanding of how international relations between States and individuals are dealt with, regarding the law.","1.

It also analyzes the concept of transparent ledgers, both public and permissioned, and focuses on using cryptography to achieve consensus, immutability, and governance of transactions. This is all part of Blockchain's ability to provide ""trusted data from untrusted sources,"" disrupting traditional accounting methodologies and international trade. The course then dives into the various methods of blockchain governance that currently exist in the marketplace as well as how consensus fits into governance. It explores how to reach consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Other aspects of the course include examining the very specific features of blockchain that solve problems that have been difficult to overcome in the past with more centralized architectures. The final part of the course takes a deep dive into the various use cases of blockchain, complete with analyzing real examples of how different industries are executing the technology and improving their business. Examining a problem, and then depicting a blockchain use case that solves the problem, will help gain an understanding of how blockchain is applied to real-world situations.",Welcome & IntroductionChapter 1.

Patterson,Introductory,Social Sciences,English,English,2–4 hours per week,4 Weeks,49,"How do the three branches of government operate? How is power shared among Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court? What role is played by federal agencies that have no direct constitutional authority oftheir own? In this part of our series on American Government, we will examine the separation of powers among the three branches of government, and the role of voters, political parties, and the broader federal bureaucracy. We’ll explore how “the people” affect the behavior of members of Congress, what constitutes success in a president’s domestic and foreign policies, and how much power an unelected judiciary should have in a democratic system.","Week 1: Congress & Constituency 
In this session, we will examine how their constituencies affect the behavior of members of Congress, including their influence on the type of bills that members are most likely to support. The 2014 farm bill will be used to highlight constituency influence. Week 2: Congress & Party 
This session will describe the role of parties in Congress and explain the developments that have contributed to party polarization within Congress. We’ll examine the 2013 government shutdown as a case study in party conflict. The session will also explain why Congress’s fragmented structure makes it difficult for Congress to take the lead on major national issues while making it perfectly suited to taking on scores of smaller issues at once. Week 3: Presidents & Domestic Policy 
This session will examine the factors that affect presidential success in the area of domestic policy. Several factors will be mentioned, but the focus will be the partisan makeup of Congress—whether a majority of its members are from the president’s party. The 1964 food stamp bill and the 1996 welfare bill will be used to illustrate the relationship between presidential success and Congress’s partisan makeup. Week 4: Presidents & Foreign Policy 
In this session, we’ll examine the president’s comparative advantages—for example, control over information—in the making of foreign policy. We’ll look particularly at the president’s war power and at executive agreements—treaty-like arrangements authorized solely by the president. President Bush’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 will serve as a case study. Week 5: Federal Bureaucracy 
In this session, we’ll examine the federal bureaucracy—its structure, staffing, and operation. We’ll also explore the challenge of holding the bureaucracy accountable for its actions. The Air Force’s F-22 fighter jet program will serve as a case study of bureaucratic politics. Week 6: Judiciary & Supreme Court 
This session will examine judicial power and the influence of politics on Supreme Court decisions. We will also consider the normative question of how much power an unelected judiciary should have in a democratic system. The primary case study in this session will be the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v.

Agile Leadership Principles and Practices,"Accelerate and improve team decisions by learning Agile’s facilitating leadership principles to unleash team productivity, motivation, and problem solving.",31838,Self-paced on your time,"The University of Maryland, College Park-University System of Maryland",John Johnson,Advanced,Engineering,English,English,2–3 hours per week,4 Weeks,199,"Version 2 of this course series delivers beyond the original agile certification. It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on “Advanced Scrum” is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Agile can often challenge project managers in the realm of leadership. Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential? ****Instead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means. ****Great leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader. ****In this course, you will learn how this new style of leadership redefines and redistributes team roles by: ****While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on Agile Process, Project, and Program Controls. ****Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).","Week 1: The first week of this course jumps right into our traditional notions of leadership, defining the concept, the characteristics of a leader, the science of leadership, and the styles that exist today across master and servant models (Primal Leadership, Team Leadership, Situational Leadership, and Transformational Leadership).Week 2: The second week exposes the reasoning behind servant leadership as the optimal approach and how old philosophies and “modern psychology” reinforce the need for leaders to empower teams. Gamification and the power of play are emphasized to ensure optimal contribution and performance across roles on the scaled Agile teams. Here you'll learn the scrum master's secrets and agile techniques for running highly productive teams. Week 3: The third week explores human decision making, its power and its faults in the form of biases, and how we can train ourselves through emotional-social intelligence and mindfulness to go faster by slowing down. Negotiation styles and techniques are also covered requiring self-reflection on how one handles conflict and manages competing, accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating challenges. These techniques are critical for product owners, scrum masters, and those leading in any capacity. Week 4: The final week focuses on putting these lessons into practice with real-world approaches and tools for managing and facilitating decisions, interactions, and environments for optimal team performance.",https://www.edx.org/course/agile-leadership-principles-2

Cancer has overtaken cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the leading cause of death in many parts of the world. It causes one in eight deaths worldwide. Global trends show that the majority of all cancer deaths occur in the low- and middle-income countries. Yet, cancer can be partly prevented and many of these deaths can be avoided. Can cancer risk be reduced through a healthy diet or lifestyle? Many studies have been conducted on the role of nutrition and physical activity in cancer prevention. This has resulted in recommendations for cancer prevention. Far less research is conducted on nutrition and cancer progression, but the evidence is increasing that a healthy diet may also play a beneficial role for cancer survivors. Join this course and learn more about the role of nutrition in the occurrence and progression of cancer. You will learn how nutrition is involved in cancer occurrence, cancer treatment, and progression. And you will discover what the evidence-base is for dietary guidelines. This course focuses on a wide range of dietary exposures (including vegetables, meat, dietary supplements, alcohol) and lifestyle factors (including body composition and physical activity) in relation to the occurrence and progression of the most common types of cancer, such as large bowel cancer , breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. This course is especially valuable for professionals (in training) from various fields related to nutrition or cancer (e.g. nutritionists, epidemiologists, health policy makers, physicians, caregivers, nutrition educators, biologists, food scientists).

According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth.This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work, for all women and men, by 2030.This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The topics covered include structural shifts in economies and work; informality, gender and child labor, the modern welfare state; the future of work, and more. The course concludes with a special module by the ILO on realizing decent work for all and achieving SDG 8.This course is for:Policy professionals who want to understand frameworks for SDG planningDevelopment practitioners seeking knowledge on goals-based developmentAdvanced undergraduates and graduate students interested in economics, development, and other key concepts related to the SDGsModule 1: Decent Work for Sustainable DevelopmentModule 2: Transitions in Employment and WorkModule 3: Challenges of Work: Informality, Gender and Child LaborModule 4: Current Policy ResponsesModule 5: Structural and Institutional Models for the Future of WorkModule 6: Future of Jobs and WorkModule 7: Special Module in Partnership with the ILO: Achieving SDG 8 and Realizing Decent Work for All","The link between employment, work, income and wealthGlobal perspectives on changes to formal employmentThe challenges of child labor, gender disparity and informal employment Modern welfare state and novel policy instruments Structural and institutional models for the future of workArtificial Intelligence and the future of workWhat it takes to achieve SDG 8 and realize decent work for all, featured in a special module by the ILO.",https://www.edx.org/course/work-and-employment-for-a-sustainable-future

We explore glasses and polymers, learn about the factors that influence their structure, and learn how materials scientists measure and describe the structure of these materials. Then we begin a discussion of the crystalline state, exploring what it means for a material to be crystalline, how we describe directions in a crystal, and how we can determine the structure of crystal through x-ray diffraction. We explore the underlying crystalline structures that underpin so many of the materials that surround us. Finally, we look at how tensors can be used to represent the properties of three-dimensional materials, and we consider how symmetry places constraints on the properties of materials. We move on to an exploration of quasi-, plastic, and liquid crystals. Then, we learn about the point defects that are present in all crystals, and we will learn how the presence of these defects lead to diffusion in materials. Next, we will explore dislocations in materials. We will introduce the descriptors that we use to describe dislocations, we will learn about dislocation motion, and will consider how dislocations dramatically affect the strength of materials. Finally, we will explore how defects can be used to strengthen materials, and we will learn about the properties of higher-order defects such as stacking faults and grain boundaries.","Part 1: An Introduction to Materials Science Part 2: Descriptors Part 3: Glasses Part 4: Polymers Part 5: An Introduction to the Crystalline State Part 6: Real and Reciprocal Space Part 7: X-Ray Diffraction Part 8: Symmetry in 2D Crystals Part 9: Point groups in 2D The 10 2D point groups Part 10: Plane groups in 2D Part 11: Symmetry in 3D Crystals Part 12: 3D Space Point groups Part 13: 3D Space Groups Part 14: An Introduction to Tensors Part 15: Quasi, Plastic, and Liquid Crystals Part 16: Introduction to Point Defects Part 17: Ionic Point Defects & Diffusion Part 18: Dislocations and Deformation Part 19: Strengthening & Surface Energy Part 20: 2-Dimensional Defects ",https://www.edx.org/course/structure-of-materials

It's learning to speak to the dead. At first the book just sits there silent as the grave, but if we listen carefully then, softly at first, the poetry begins to speak to us and we find ourselves speaking to it in response. Dante is the master of speaking with the dead. He convinces us that the dead can tell us things we do not know—things we cannot discover about the meaning of life because we are still in the middle of it. He shows us that conversations with the dead can change the way that we look at life. You and I may not have enough imagination to explore the realms of death that open up in the middle of life, and Dante knows that no one can find their way through life without a guide. This course will help you discover the magic of Dante's poetry and Dante will teach you to imagine the deepest terrors and the highest hopes that are still undiscovered in your heart. Only then will you be in a position to decide finally, for yourself, who you choose to become. In this course, you will begin to question for yourself the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy , which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the questions “who am I?” and “what meaning or value can my life have?” Dante struggled with the same questions before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. This course is presented to you through the MyDante platform, an online environment developed by Professor Frank Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS). Throughout the course, you will be asked to reflect on Dante's interpretation of freedom, how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and whether we might be able to find appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern lives. You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and genuinely contemplative. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity, and responsibility as a person.As a self-paced course, the primary goal is to giveyou the opportunity to explore Dante's poem as fully as their interest and time allows. A minimal expectation for an initial, basic comprehension of the material and successful completion of the self-assessment process would be approximately 75 hours forthis complete course.",Book1: Vita Nuova ,https://www.edx.org/course/the-divine-comedy-dantes-journey-to-freedom

Cualquier lugar en donde nosotros decidamos intervenir y que las plantas sean las protagonistas es un espacio verde. Ese espacio verde puede tener diferentes tamaños, y de acuerdo a eso, algunos criterios que nos permiten diferenciarlos son, si la superficie que involucra ese espacio verde es de más o de menos que una hectárea.Si son grandes superficies mayores a una hectárea, generalmente se habla de parques. Si son de menos de una hectárea y en general de uso residencial, urbano se habla de jardines.Hay jardines botánicos especializados que tienen mayor tamaño, y que se dedican a una actividad específica. Y otros jardines como los que ustedes van a poder desarrollar en su casa, en alguna institución educativa, o donde se lo soliciten, como un centro vecinal, por ejemplo, de menor tamaño, y generalmente esos son los que nosotros conocemos como jardines.En los jardines la protagonista es la vegetación. La vegetación es el conjunto de plantas, que en éste caso van a componer éste jardín. Para hablar de las plantas y saber cómo intervenir en un jardín, tenemos que recordar cuáles son las tres partes básicas de toda planta: raíces, tallo y las hojas y éstas hojas que se modifican y se transforman en flores que luego darán frutos, que en su interior van a contener la semilla que muchas veces vamos a usar para sembrar en nuestros jardines.De a poco vamos a ir viendo qué conviene hacer y cómo, en los distintos tipos de jardines que vamos a ir enseñando en éste curso.Los vamos a estar acompañando a lo largo de éste recorrido, para que el jardín que decidan hacer con la intencionalidad que ustedes le vayan a dar les permita conectarse nuevamente con la naturaleza, si es que estaban un pocodesconectados, revalorizar la flora en la que ustedes viven, y de alguna manera, volver hacer un uso más eficiente de los recursos naturales.Este curso está destinado a emprendedores y amantes de la naturaleza.¿Quieres tener una vida más sana, en armonía con el ambiente? Un jardín es un espacio en el que podemos darnos un momento con nosotros mismos, disfrutar de un ambiente puro en el que liberamos nuestra mente y espíritu, donde podemos regalarnos unos minutos de calma, ser creativos y compartir con nuestros seres queridos.En él, podremos encontrar un lugar para conectarnos con la naturaleza, al ver los insectos y las aves llegar, las plantas crecer, florecer y reverdecer...Si esto te es atractivo, es el momento de diseñar, construir y/o mantener tu propio jardín. En este curso te damos las claves para lograrlo, de manera sencilla, amigable y atractiva. Y por qué no, si quieres ayudar a otros a disfrutar de la naturaleza, puedes encontrar con estas orientaciones la forma de emprender un oficio.Los contenidos te enseñarán a preparar los suelos, a elaborar compost, a crear distintos tipos de jardines (acuáticos -en maceta o en estanque, xerofíticos, ornamentales, aromáticos, con césped) y a realizar el mantenimiento (corte, desmalezado y alcorque). ¡Te aseguramos que podrás lograr tus objetivos y, lo mejor, lo vas a disfrutar!","IntroducciónMódulo 1 : Preparación del suelo.

Solid Waste Management,"Solid waste is one of the most pressing issues of our time. World over, people are generating greater amounts of garbage without much thought. The phrase “out of sight, out of mind” holds true for many of us when it comes to waste issues. Once garbage leaves our homes and offices and factories, do we really consider what happens to it, who’s collecting it, or what impact it’s having on our environment and our health?",7668,Self-paced on your time,World Bank Group,OLC and SURR ,Introductory,Environmental Studies,English,English,2–3 hours per week,6 Weeks,5,"Solid waste management (SWM) is a crucial function of local governments around the world, and directly affects public health, the environment, and livelihoods. However, rapid urbanization and population growth place multiple pressures on solid waste management systems, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the urban poor are most affected by lack of access to basic SWM services, such as waste collection and disposal.Yet, the sector also provides numerous opportunities: Improving solid waste management provides a cleaner and healthier environment; improves livability for all city residents; and attracts new investment and tourism, which improve a city’s economic competitiveness, creating jobs, and new business opportunities. SWM also contributes to new sources of energy thus tackling climate change challenges. In these ways, SWM is directly relevant to the World Bank’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.Historically, the highest expenditures of local governments is in the SWM sector but – particularly in low- and middle-income country cities – the bulk of expenses goes towards collection and transport instead of treatment and disposal. Another challenge is ensuring the financial sustainability of SWM projects and cost recovery once SWM infrastructure has been created. The world is generating increasing amounts of waste, with large amounts (primarily plastics) ending up in the oceans. However, there is also a paradigm shift from thinking about waste as something to be disposed – “out of sight out of mind” – to a resource that can be used for energy generation, reduce the use and costs associated with virgin resources, and improve our climate change efforts.Given this background, this e-learning course is designed to look at the SWM sector, with a focus on MSW, from several angles in order to simplify concepts and promote understanding of this sector.","This course runs for 6 weeks.Week 1: Overview of Solid Waste ManagementUnderstand the basics of SWM, with a focus on municipal solid waste (MSW); introduce core concepts of MSW; importance of SWM for economic development and environmental protection; linking SWM and climate change and marine litter.Week 2: Solid Waste Management Chain IUnderstand the steps in the solid waste management chain; examine appropriate methods of MSW collection, transport, and transfer; learn about processes and costs for various steps from collection to disposal; gain insight into financial, technical, and operational capacities of technologies along the chain.Week 3: Solid Waste Management Chain IIUnderstand the steps in the solid waste management chain; examine appropriate methods of MSW treatment, recycling, and disposal; understand processes and costs for various steps from collection to disposal; learn about key issues in operation and maintenance of treatment and disposal facilities, and the value of products from treatment and the value of proper disposal; gain insight into financial, technical, and operational capacities of technologies along the chain.Week 4: Financial Aspects of Solid Waste ManagementLearn about financial aspects of various technologies including capex, opex, and cost recovery; learn about various funding mechanisms for establishing SMW projects.Week 5: Policies, Institutions, and the Informal SectorLearn how enabling conditions through policies and legislation help drive economic activity, create employment opportunities, and provide a framework for local governments in the sector; learn how institutions and coordination can improve service delivery and financial performance of the sector.Week 6: Circular Economy and Innovations in the SWM SectorLearn about technological innovations and the role of informal workers and women in the sector; become aware of a shift in thinking of waste as a resource to be managed, and not simply disposed of.",https://www.edx.org/course/solid-waste-management

It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on “Advanced Scrum” is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience. ****However, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as: ****In this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.This shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career. ****So how do programs ensure smooth project delivery? ****This answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it’s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes. ****While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope either completes your certificate with us or takes you to one of our most popular courses in the series, ""Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.""Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).","Week 1: The first week of the control course examines the reason for controlling projects, why traditional controls such as Earned Value Management fail so often, and the three key components to any controlling process: value, constraints, and verification. Systems Engineering models are considered for their effectiveness in controlling, with an emphasis on the predominant controlling approach, the V-Model, and how it equivocates testing with development.Week 2: The second week examines how control is managed across the project lifecycle, with the three Ps of management: people, process, and product. Real-world approaches and tools are discussed for all three levers across varying staffing approaches, release and sprint processes for quality assurance, and the use of product-level tools for quality control.Week 3: The third week drives home the need to “begin with the end in mind” by closing User Stories incrementally using a Definition of Done that links the three Ps together across each sprint cycle (planning, execution, and control).Week 4: The final fourth week addresses controlling Agile processes at scale, from sampling and building intuition across Agile team ceremonies, to managing team decisions and performance, and even portfolios of projects using simplified metrics. The fourth week will also look at how to align portfolio and project management metrics to an organization’s strategy as a means of managing up the risks of being defunded or constrained by corporate policy.",https://www.edx.org/course/agile-for-project-control-2

e-Learning on Digital Agriculture,"Agriculture is no exception to digital revolution, going beyond a simple adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). According to ICRISAT, digital agriculture is defined as “ICT and data ecosystems to support the development and delivery of timely, targeted information and services to make farming profitable and sustainable while delivering safe nutritious and affordable food for all.”",6238,Self-paced on your time,World Bank Group,OLC and SURR ,Introductory,Environmental Studies,English,English,2–3 hours per week,5 Weeks,5,"Digital Agricultural Technologies (DATs) are innovations that enable farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs to leapfrog to increase their productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, facilitate access to markets, improve nutritional outcomes and enhance resilience to climate change. These technologies range from mobile apps to digital identities for farmers to solar applications for agriculture to portable agriculture devices. DATs are increasingly becoming indispensable in the global food and agriculture sector, from fast and convenient information delivery to providing virtual marketplaces. Considering the fact that digital technologies can accelerate agro-food outcomes is juxtaposed with low adoption rates of the same, the World Bank’s operations are increasingly incorporating digital agriculture as a critical element in its operations. Thus, it is important to study digital agriculture technologies in further detail.This five-week course will provide a high-level overview of DAT concepts, potential impact, range of technologies available, used cases as well as forward-looking technologies. The course will introduce the participants to different agriculture data platforms already available and will encourage them to discover the scope and utility of the open data platforms for analytics and intelligence in agriculture. Participants will be required to engage in discussion forums with their peers and complete quizzes throughout the course.","This course runs for 5 weeks.Week 1: Overview of Digital AgricultureThe first module of this course outlines what ICTs and digital technologies are being used in agriculture and how. It will explore the key drivers of ICT-enabled services in agriculture as well as the lessons learned so far. The module also introduces the Principles of Digital Development established in 2017 to capture the shifting role of technologies in global development. The second section of the module spotlights the impact of mobile phones and mobile technologies on agriculture and rural development.Week 2: ICT and Digital Tools for Enhancing Productivity on the FarmIn the modules, they are two sections; first section focuses on their impact on on-farm productivity; the second section focuses on improving farming practices through extension and advisory services.Section 1: How can farmers and governments use ICT and digital tools to increase agricultural productivity? At the local level, farmers can use ICT to match cropping practices to climatic trends, use inputs and resources environmentally and sustainably, and cope with productivity threats. At the national level, public officials can adjust policies to reflect the data collected with ICT and digital tools, predict food supplies, target social programs, or promote yield technologies.Section 2: ICT and digital tools have the potential to transform extension and advisory services in several ways—including changing the way in which extension agents do their work, but also changing the ways extension institutions are organized and staffed. The emergence of public and private innovators and start-ups with business models built around ICT-enabled advisory services signals the types of transformations that are likely to come.Week 3: Empowering Smallholder Farmers through ICT/Digital Tools in Financial ServicesNew channels for delivering financial services (facilitated by ICT), new players, and greater competition enable service providers to offer a larger suite of financial products and services and acquire better financial information, some of which is useful for government regulation and policy development. A number of non-bank institutions have developed innovative approaches to financing agriculture, enabled by or integrated with ICT, including mobile financial services, branchless banking, ATMs, and smartcards.While the digital revolution is reaching rural areas in many developing countries, the rural-urban digital divide remains, and rural women face a triple divide: digital, rural, and gender. This module looks at the benefits of ICT when placed in the hands of men and women working in agriculture and rural areas. It examines the challenges that must be overcome and provides recommendations for rural communities to take full and equal advantage of ICT.Week 4: Strengthening Agricultural Market Access with ICT and Digital ToolsFarmers use mobile phones to build a network of contacts and draw on this wider expertise to obtain critical information more rapidly. The mobile phone, its special applications, and the Internet are essentially becoming management tools for farmers, especially in relation to market intelligence. Greater access to information helps farmers make better decisions about transportation and logistics, price and location, supply and demand, diversification of their product base, and access to inputs.ICT also facilitates market research, increasingly using live information. This market information strengthens farmers’ position in their day-to-day trading. Over time, market intelligence enables them to focus on satisfying consumers’ and buyers’ demands and on developing relationships with stakeholders in the next stage of the value chain. The key development challenge lies in assembling and disseminating this information in a timely manner, not just to traders or larger-scale farmers but also to smallholders.Week 5: Using ICT for Remote Sensing, Crowdsourcing, and Big DataThis module consists of three sections. (1) Remote sensing, (2) Crowdsourcing and crowd mapping, and (3) Big data for analytics:The first section , “Remote Sensing for Sustainable Agriculture,” focuses on the different types of geographical solutions that producers and others in agricultural value chains can use to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and ultimately bring about more sustainable agricultural practices.The second section on “Crowdsourcing and Crowd mapping: The Power of Volunteers,” focuses on how advances in social networking and data collection are enabling individuals to share hyperlocalized data in ways that have the potential to benefit society more broadly.The last section, “Big Data for Analytics,” focuses on how all of these agriculture-related data collected globally can be mined and analyzed in ways that lead to meaningful insights about how agriculture can be made more sustainable and productive.",https://www.edx.org/course/e-learning-on-digital-agriculture

Giller: ","Week 1: Introduction
This first week we are setting the scene for the global food situation today and projected demand and supply options tomorrow. Covering the four pillars of global food systems, we will zoom in on availability issues, and more in particular on crop production, as central theme of this course. Photosynthesis plays a key role in this process, turning solar light into food, which fuels mankind. Analogously to physical principles applied in building houses, you’ll be acquainted to the bio-physical principles in growing crops. Week 2: Potential production
Potential production is the simplest representation of crop growth, defined by the crop's genetic potential and the ambient growth factors radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration in the air. Under perfect crop management, with no limitation of water and nutrients, and a weed, pathogen and pest free environment, crops reach their potential production. This week focuses on the conversion of carbon dioxide into plant biomass as powered by solar radiation, with temperature as modifying factor. Based on variation in solar radiation and temperature around the globe, you’ll be able to calculate potential crop yields for different locations. Week 3: Water limited production
In the process of fixing carbon dioxide from the air into biomass, crops inevitably lose water by transpiration. When transpired water from the leaf surface is not adequately replenished through water uptake by the roots, crop production becomes water-limited, resulting in lower yields. Accounting for the evaporative demand of the air and water availability to the crop, water-limited production can be assessed. Conversely, to reach potential yield, you may determine the amount of water required through irrigation, as a yield increasing measure. Week 4: Nutrient limited production
In addition to water, nutrients are essential to crop production to support physiological processes, like photosynthesis. Various nutrients are absorbed from the soil by the roots. When nutrient availability falls short, production becomes nutrient-limited. In that situation nutrient application by manure or artificial fertilizers is a yield increasing measure.. Week 5: Actual production
Actual crop production refers a situation where production is further reduced by effects of weed, pests (insects, mites, nematodes, rodents, and birds), diseases (fungi, bacteria, viruses) and/or pollutants. This introduces an extra level of complexity in plant production. In spite of intensive crop protection measures in some parts of the world, the actual production is the common production situation for the majority of the world's agricultural production systems. We will look at how weeds, and pests and diseases affect crop yields and what measures can be taken to prevent losses. Week 6: Synthesis
Having tackled the three distinguished production situations separately in the previous weeks, we now come back to complete the diagram reflecting the 'principles of production ecology'. Hopefully, it means more to you now and you can use it in analysing the impact of genetics, environment and management on crop yields, as will be discussed in this synopsis.",https://www.edx.org/course/sustainable-food-security-crop-production
Data Structures Fundamentals,This course is part of a MicroMasters® Program,42381,Self-paced on your time,"The University of California, San Diego",Daniel Kane-Alexander S. Kulikov-Michael Levin-Neil Rhodes,Intermediate,Computer Science,English,English,8–10 hours per week,6 Weeks,99,"A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this course are:We look forward to seeing you in this course! We know it will make you a better programmer.","Module 1: Basic Data Structures In this module, you will learn about the basic data structures used throughout the rest of this course. We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how they’re used in Computer Science, how they’re implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you’ve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure.Module 2: Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis In this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees.Module 3: Priority Queues and Disjoint Set Union We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch.Modules 4 and 5: Hash Tables In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average!Module 6: Binary Search Trees In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced.",https://www.edx.org/course/data-structures-fundamentals

Kulikov-Michael Levin,Intermediate,Computer Science,English,English,8–10 hours per week,6 Weeks,99,"In this course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, you will learn basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems, which arise in practical applications such as sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.This course will cover theories, including:You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).","Module 1: Welcome
Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on.Module 2: Introduction
In this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on naïve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!Module 3: Greedy Algorithms
In this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.Module 4: Divide-and-Conquer
In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!Modules 5 and 6: Dynamic Programming
In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.",https://www.edx.org/course/algorithmic-design-and-techniques

Join this exploration of DNA structure, packaging, replication, and manipulation.The course utilizes video lectures, research articles, case studies, and molecular models to convey information. The course grade will be based on questions with each video lecture, quizzes, homework, and a final exam.","Lecture 1: DNA Structure Comprised of only four monomers, DNA serves as thegenetic material of living organisms. We explore how DNA was identifiedas the genetic material, review the characteristics and structure of DNA,examine the information encoded in this interesting macromolecule, and explore implications of variations in DNA size and sequence. Lecture 2: DNA Organization We explore how DNA is arranged, packaged, and organized within the cell. We examine chromatin architecture, how chromatin is modified by histones, and how epigenetics can affect gene expression. Lecture 3: DNA Replication I We explore the mechanisms by which DNA is copied and the complications that arise due to the asymmetric construction of DNA with respect to its 3' and 5' ends. We examine the dynamic nature of the replication proteins and the exquisite specificity with which these proteinscan catalyze essential biochemical reactions, and how enzymatic activity can be regulated within the larger context of the cell. Lecture 4: DNA Replication II We explore further the replication machinerythat allows for the coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis during DNA replication, a feature of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication. We examine the initiation of DNA replication at origins of replication. We also discuss the involvement of nucleosomes and histones in this process, which is a unique feature of eukaryotic DNA. We also examinetermination of DNA replication and the involvement of telomerase in solving a unique problem of eukaryoticDNA replication: shortening of chromosomal endsduring DNA replication. Lecture 5: DNA Manipulation We examine the manipulation of DNA. The cell can restore (or sometimes alter) DNA by repairing damage from a variety of environmental sources. Repair of double-stranded breaks includes recombination (or exchanging DNA sequences between two different dsDNAs). We examine methods of DNA amplification, analysis, ""cloning,"" and sequencing. These forms of ""manipulating"" DNA employ enzymes and functional properties that we have discussed.

In Step 5,we extract market segments and group consumers using distance-based, hierarchical, and partitioning methods; hybrid approaches; and model-based methods. We also explain data structure analysis. Module 4: Steps 6 and 7
In Steps 6 and 7, we profile and describe segments. We use traditional approaches as well as visualisation techniques to identify key characteristics of market segments. In Step 7 we develop and visualise a complete picture of market segments; this includes testing and predicting segment differences in descriptor variables. Module 5: Steps 8, 9 and 10
In Step 8, we select the target segments including the tasks targeting decision and market segment evaluation. In Step 9 we customise the marketing mix. We also discuss the implications of market segmentation for marketing mix decisions concerning product, price, place,and promotion. Finally, in Step 10, we evaluate the success of the segmentation strategy, and stability of segment membership. We conclude with a discussion of segment hopping and segment evolution.",https://www.edx.org/course/market-segmentation-analysis

They have been there for over 45,000 years. Through the millennia, ancient wisdom and culture have guided the people throughtheir interactions with the land, nature, and with one another. In 1826, the Noongar land was first colonised by the British. What unfolded in the years that followed was catastrophic for Noongar people; the impacts of which are still seen and felt today. Despite this dark history, Noongar culture has survived. Today, Noongar people are passionate about preserving their cultural knowledge while embracing the changes that come with living in a contemporary society. This course provides an introduction to Noongar culture and language. Learners will be taken on a journey through Noongar boodja (Noongar country). They'll joinNoongar guides as they share knowledge and personal experiences of history, land,and culture. Learners will be introduced to conversational Noongar - learning words and phrases that can be used in simple dialogue.

Sprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery,"Drive speed into any project with prioritized backlogs, limiting work-in-process, and engaging the entire agile team in effective sprint planning.",10654,Self-paced on your time,"The University of Maryland, College Park-University System of Maryland",John Johnson,Advanced,Engineering,English,English,2–3 hours per week,4 Weeks,199,"Version 2 of this course series delivers beyond the original agile certification. It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on “Advanced Scrum” is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile. First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Agile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.”Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).","Week 1: The first week focuses the discussion on Agile to its primary benefit, Speed, and how to easily calculate and prove its supremacy in benefits of any project management method because of timing impacts and market changes outside a project manager’s control. Week 2: The second week explores why and how varying scope is the most powerful method to achieve speed; introducing the Exponential Pareto Principle and how to apply it effectively. Perhaps the most important lesson is that not all product backlog items are equal, and in fact, most don't matter at all! Week 3: The third week dives into second tier methods for achieving speed through sizing, simplicity, and sprints with real-world examples ranging from air and space craft to software. Team members work together to ensure a smooth glide on the burndown chart by actively managing work in process during daily scrum sessions. Week 4: The last week teaches ground-level techniques to avoid delays, increase speed, and apply a full range of planning, execution, and control techniques that will guarantee 2x or better improvement on traditional projects.

These are Eyrbyggja Saga, Njáls Saga and Grettis Saga. We will explore the landscape and archaeology of Iceland to see how they can add to our understanding of the Sagas as well as take an in-depth look at the most memorable characters from the Sagas. Participants will have opportunities to engage with an online community of Icelandic and international scholars, learners and others to explore topics relating to Icelandic and Nordic Medieval history beyond the course curriculum. The Medieval Icelandic Sagas course is associated with a two-year international master’s program in Viking and Medieval Norse Studies at the University of Iceland.","Week 1 : Historical overview. We explore what is unique about the Sagas as a genre, compare some contrasting views on their origin and examine how the Sagas are related to other works of European Medieval literature. Week 2 : Manuscripts. We get an overview of the world of Old Norse manuscripts and talk to some experts of Icelandic textual criticism about the extant (and lost) manuscripts of our three main Sagas. Week 3 : Landscape and Archaeology. We visit a few of the most important historical sites of Iceland and ask how they can add to our understanding of the Sagas. Week 4 : Saga Characters. We meet some memorable characters from our three main Sagas and look at their careers and conflicts. By contextualizing their biographies we come to understand the functioning of the Medieval Icelandic Commonwealth. Week 5 : Paganism and Christianity. We ask how traces of Norse Mythology can be interpreted in the Sagas, even if they are written over two hundred years after paganism officially comes to a close in Iceland. We evaluate the impact of Iceland's conversion and how it is described in the Sagas. Week 6 : The Supernatural. We address the profusion of supernatural elements, the contradiction at the core of the Sagas' presumed realism.",https://www.edx.org/course/the-medieval-icelandic-sagas-2

Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?
AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

They want to place an order online and pick it up an hour later on their way to work, or return at the store an order they had placed online. We have been studying for many years how traditional retailers can become omnichannel retailers. It is not an easy transition and requires a fundamental change in the retailer’s processes, systems and strategy. This transformation is not about small adjustments but a complete redesign of the retailer’s business model.In this course, part of the Retail Management Professional Certificate program, you will learn from retailers that are successfully navigating this transformation. You will explore how to attract omnichannel customers, what fulfillment options these customers expect, how retailers can leverage their online and brick and mortar presence, and what retailers need to support an omnichannel strategy. By the end of the course, you won’t be thinking about separated retail channels but one integrated retailer that is aligned to best serve today customer’s needs.We have designed this course based on our own work in omnichannel retail. The course will suit a variety of participants from retail owners and undergraduate business majors, to retail specialists.",Week 1: The Omnichannel CustomerWeek 2: Fulfilling Omni-channel DemandWeek 3: Omni-channel JourneysWeek 4: Supporting an Omnichannel strategy,https://www.edx.org/course/omnichannel-strategy-and-management

Bishop-David S. Lee,Introductory,Economics & Finance,English,"English, English, 中文, 中文",1–5 hours per week,6 Weeks,199,"FinTech has started a global revolution in the financial services industry, and the transformation will only increase in coming years. There are many ways in which FinTech can improve the lives of people around the world; however, those same technologies can also be used to enslave, coerce, track, and control people. Accordingly, it is appropriate and necessary to consider the implications of the introduction of these technologies so that they are utilized properly, regulated sufficiently, and their adoption does not come at the expense of societal growth. This 6-week online coursecovers 6 modules, representing the full spectrum of finance, technology, and the introduction of FinTech solutions globally. We will ask questions that are not often asked or addressed when new technologies are adopted. Why should we adopt FinTech solutions, and what are the best ways to introduce disruptive technologies? How does blockchain technology change the way we provide financial services, and how should blockchain technology be governed? Is FinTech creating risks in cybersecurity and how can technology help us prevent financial crimes? As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and adopted, will human biases and prejudices be built into such mechanisms? And at a larger scope, should FinTech lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance, or will existing institutions adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets? Through discussing and attempting to answer these questions, you will understand better how the introduction of these technologies can benefit or harm society. And through considering the proper application or introduction of such technologies, you will learn to make better decisions as an individual and organization when facing the question: is FinTech our savior or a villain?","Introduction: Ethics of Finance and Emerging Technologies 
This module will provide a historical and broad perspective of ethical issues relating to finance and the introduction or adoption of emerging technologies. Blockchain and its Governance
This module will expand off the Introduction to FinTech course (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-fintech), to consider the most relevant and ethical ways such technology should be implemented, in a number of different industries or product segmentation. In particular, data collection, customer privacy, and transactional issues will be covered in this module. Cybersecurity & Crimes 
FinTech can make it easier and cheaper for banks to monitor and control financial transactions, thus reducing fraud and reducing bank costs. But at the same time, these tools can be used to steal money and other corporate secrets, hide illegality (including purchases of weapons, drugs, etc.), and finance terrorists and other criminal organizations. Accordingly, this module will consider the implications of such important issues. AI & FinTech 
In this module we will consider the implications of building our own concepts of “human” morality into amoral machines, as well as a consideration of whether human biases and prejudices can or will be built into such mechanisms, whether purposefully or unintentionally. Institutionalization vs. Decentralization 
One of the key reasons people are calling for FinTech is for its decentralized nature, thus democratizing finance, and allowing regular people to participate more fully and affordably in financial transactions through technologies like cryptocurrencies, non-government issued IDs, and P2P lending. In this module we will address some large questions, considering whether FinTech should lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance. Or whether existing institutions will adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets. Big Questions Relating to the Introduction of FinTech 
In this final module, we will consider some of the many outstanding questions and purposes of introducing FinTech to the world, exploring the many ways that FinTech can both help and hurt society. We will discuss financial inclusion, sustainable development, and many other positive aspects of FinTech development. Conversely, we will also consider how these same technologies and solutions could potentially be used to inhibit access to financial markets, or worse.",https://www.edx.org/course/fintech-ethics-and-risks

Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets,Understand flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and discover how to analyse the performance of a scramjet.,19043,Self-paced on your time,The University of Queensland,Professor David J. Mee-Professor Richard G. Morgan-Professor Michael Smart-Associate Professor Vincent Wheatley,Advanced,Engineering,English,English,4–8 hours per week,4 Weeks,99,"A flow is called hypersonic if the Mach number is greater than 5. This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics - from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.","Section 1. What is Hypersonics?
This section provides an introduction to the course. What we mean by ""hypersonic speeds"" is discussed and examples of vehicles that travel at such speeds are given. Shock waves and scramjets are also introduced. The rocket equation is introduced to show why staging of launch vehicles is used. The scramjet engine arrangement used throughout the course is outlined. Section 2. Isentropic Flow
The times when a flow can be considered to be ""isentropic"" are introduced. This leads on to the fundamentals of compressible flow and steady adiabatic flows. We use the flow in a scramjet nozzle to demonstrate the principles. Section 3. Shock Waves
Normal and oblique shock waves form when objects travel at close to, or in excess of, the speed of sound. In this section, methods for modelling the flow across shock waves are presented and discussed. Results from experiments are used to show the influence of flow deflection angle on the shock wave formed at hypersonic speeds. We use the flow in a scramjet intake to demonstrate the principles. Section 4. Combustors in Scramjets
Flows with friction, heat addition and stoichiometry are important considerations for scramjet combustors. In this section example problems are worked through to show the importance of friction and heat addition to fluid flow at different Mach numbers. Stoichiometric concepts are developed so that the use of different fuels can be modelled. Section 5. Hypersonics
This section looks at hypersonic flight, flight corridors and vehicle design. Hypersonics facilities, such as reflected shock tunnels and expansion tubes, are described since these are used to test scientific hypotheses related to hypersonic flight. Section 6. Scramjets
This section describes the state of scramjet technology as it exists today, examines the history of scramjets and then looks at future possibilities of scramjet technology. The overall thrust of an air breathing engine is calculated. Section 7. Project
In the final section, students are required to analyse the flow through an engine and determine the Specific Impulse for their own scramjet design.",https://www.edx.org/course/hypersonics-from-shock-waves-to-scramjets-2

El reloj biológico es la respuesta del cuerpo humano (fisiología) a diferentes etapas del día, este reloj biológico es aquel que le dice al cuerpo que debe estar despierto durante el día y descansar en la noche. Losritmos biológicoshan surgido en respuesta ala alternancia entre el día y la noche, y las estaciones. La cronobiología es la ciencia que estudia los ritmos biológicos; los cambios de nuestro reloj. Este curso en línea te ayudará a conocer tu reloj biológico y el impacto que los factores externos tienen en él, esto es importante ya que puede ayudarte a mejorar tu calidad de vida. Acaso¿no han sentido alguna vez que poseemos un reloj interno, que nos despierta por la mañana antes que suene el despertador?,¿o que nos avisa cuando sentimos apetito, y descubrimos que ya es hora de almorzar?,¿o al sentirnos cansados, tarde en la noche, percibimos que necesitamos ir a dormir? Estas y muchas otras actividades que realizamos a diario; sueño, apetito, actividad/reposo, estudio, trabajo, etc., como así también procesos biológicos que ocurren en nuestro organismo; producción de hormonas, temperatura corporal, metabolismo, cambian rítmicamente a lo largo del día. Estos cambios constituyen los ritmos biológicos y aquellos que presentan un periodo cercano a las 24 horas se denominan“circadianos”(del latín, circa: cercano, diano: día). Losritmos biológicoshan surgido en respuesta a los cambios cíclicos del medio ambiente que nos rodea: la alternancia día/noche, las estaciones, es por esto que los organismos vivos contamos con un sistema denominado sistema o ritmo circadiano que permite medir el tiempo internamente, adaptarnos a tales cambios ambientales que ocurren a lo largo del día, y anticiparnos a la llegada de los mismos. Efectivamente losrelojes biológicosse encuentran distribuidos a lo largo de todo el organismo. Estos relojes internos regulan diversas funciones fisiológicas y conductuales con un periodo cercano a las 24 horas pero no exactamente de 24 horas, por eso se hace necesario ajustarlos diariamente a través de señales externas del medio ambiente: luz, temperatura, alimentación, etc. La luz constituye la señal externa más potente para sincronizar el reloj central ubicado en el cerebro. Una vez sincronizado este reloj, envía señales al resto del organismo para coordinar las actividades de forma rítmica.","Introducción: La vida en la Tierra se originó y evolucionó en un ambiente cíclico como consecuencia de la rotación de nuestro planeta sobre su eje y alrededor del sol, lo que ocasiona la alternancia día/noche a lo largo de las 24 horas y con estos los ciclos de luz/oscuridad, como así también las estaciones y los marcados cambios en la duración del día y la noche, en la cantidad e intensidad de luz, e importantes variaciones en la temperatura a lo largo del día/noche y las estaciones. Durante muchos años hemos conocido que los organismos vivos, incluyendo los humanos, contamos con un reloj biológico interno que nos permite medir el tiempo interno.

Introducción a las ondas gravitacionales,"En este curso, junto con la Dra. Gabriela González, vamos a viajar por uno de los descubrimientos científicos recientes más importantes, donde vamos a aprender cómo se producen y cómo se detectan las ondas gravitacionales y por qué lo hacemos.",8657,Self-paced on your time,Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,Gabriela González,Introductory,Science,Español,"English, Español",5–7 hours per week,4 Weeks,50,"En este curso conocerás sobre las ondas gravitacionales de forma fácil y enseñado por una experta del proyecto LIGO; Gabriela González. Algunos de los temas que cubriremos: • Los astrónomos modernos combinan datos de múltiples tipos de telescopios para crear imágenes compuestas de objetos en el espacio. • Los agujeros negros son por definición imposibles de observar directamente usando telescopios de luz, ya que ninguna luz puede escapar de su extrema gravedad. • La única manera de estudiar los agujeros negros usando telescopios de luz es observar cualquier gas y polvo que caiga en ellos. Esto puede revelar información sobre un agujero, como la frecuencia con la que gira alrededor de su eje. Comprensión de la gravedad. • En el siglo XVII, Isaac Newton propuso una ley universal de gravitación que concebía la gravedad como una fuerza entre dos masas (m1m1 y m2m2) separadas por una distancia rr según la ecuación: F = Gm1m2r2F = Gm1m2r2 • La teoría de Newton es muy exacta para la mayoría de las situaciones y es ampliamente utilizada hoy en día. Sin embargo, Newton estaba preocupado por la acción a distancia, quería entender cómo dos masas se conocen y se influyen mutuamente sin enviar ninguna señal. • Este problema no se resolvió hasta que Albert Einstein propuso la relatividad general en 1916. En su nueva concepción la gravedad no es una fuerza, sino la geometría del espacio-tiempo. Los objetos masivos causan que el espacio-tiempo se curve, y esta curvatura es lo que influye en el movimiento de otros objetos en el espacio-tiempo. El mensajero gravitacional de Newton resultó ser el espacio-tiempo en sí. • Einstein se dio cuenta de que objetos masivos (no esféricamente simétricos) sometidos a aceleración u oscilación producirían distorsiones que se extenderían a través del espacio-tiempo como ondulaciones en un estanque. Estas ondulaciones se llaman ondas gravitacionales. • Al igual que las ondas electromagnéticas, las ondas gravitatorias transportan energía y tienen amplitudes (llamadas tensión para las ondas gravitacionales) y frecuencias asociadas con ellas. Las ondas gravitatorias se representan a menudo como formas de onda, que demuestran su frecuencia y amplitud mientras que cambian con el tiempo. • Las ondas gravitacionales interactúan muy débilmente con la materia, pasando por todo esencialmente sin cambios. Esto es muy útil para la astronomía porque significa que cualquier señal detectada permanece prácticamente inalterada desde cuando se generó en la fuente.Hace no mucho tiempo, hace apenas un par de años, anunciamos en el 2016, que habíamos descubierto por primera vez ondas gravitacionales. En introducción a ondas gravitacionales vamos a explicar su significado, son una predicción de la teoría de Einstein de la teoría de la relatividad general, vamos hablar de la primera teoría de la relatividad especial después de la relatividad general y de cómo se producen o cómo pensaba Albert Einstein que se producían las ondas gravitacionales. Después vamos a hablar de qué sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales, en realidad no sabemos producir nosotros ondas gravitacionales, sabemos que hay sistemas astrofísicos que producen las ondas gravitacionales. Es así que hablaremos de agujeros negros, de estrellas de neutrones, del universo temprano produciendo ondas gravitacionales. Más tarde hablaremos de cómo se pueden detectar las ondas gravitacionales, que ha sido una campaña muy difícil que ha tomado casi medio siglo; Pero hay detectores de distintos tipos, vamos a explicar los distintos tipos de detectores, y más en detalle los detectores que se usaron para detectar por primera vez, por segunda y por tercera vez, también, ondas gravitacionales. Y finalmente, el tema más interesante, es la astrofísica de las ondas gravitacionales que aprendemos porqué las buscamos, y cómo podemos aprender de los sistemas que las producen, no solo midiendo ondas gravitacionales con distintos instrumentos, sino también midiendo otras ondas, ondas electromagnéticas, u otras partículas producidas por los mismos sistemas.","Introducción: En este curso vamos a hablar de las ondas gravitacionales.

Módulo 2: ¿Qué es lo que produce ondas gravitacionales? De acuerdo a la teoría, cualquier masa que no sea esférica y este acelerándose produce ondas gravitacionales. Yo misma aquí estoy produciendo ondas gravitaciones, la cuestión es ¿qué sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales detectables? Módulo 3: En este módulo vamos hablar de cómo se detectan las ondas gravitacionales, ¿cuál es el efectos que queremos detectar? Lo que queremos hacer es medir distancias de manera muy precisa. Tenemos muchas maneras de medir distancias, aún distancias a estrellas; cuán precisamente necesitamos medirlas, esa es la cuestión. ¿Cuán grande es la distorsión del espacio tiempo?
